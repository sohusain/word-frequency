      "backward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring\r\n",

      "gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and\r\n",
      "managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a\r\n",
      "respectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet\r\n",
      "country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a\r\n",
      "parlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s\r\n",

      "required for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such reasons would have\r\n",

      "sentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to\r\n",
      "accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea\r\n",
      "knew many passages of Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart;\r\n",
      "and to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity,\r\n",
      "made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for\r\n",
      "Bedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life\r\n",
      "involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and\r\n",
      "artificial protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned\r\n",
      "by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might\r\n",
      "frankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there;\r\n",
      "she was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing\r\n",
      "whatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom,\r\n",
      "to make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a\r\n",
      "quarter where she had not sought it. Certainly such elements in the\r\n",
      "character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and\r\n",
      "hinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks,\r\n",
      "vanity, and merely canine affection. With all this, she, the elder of\r\n",
      "the sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since\r\n",
      "they were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans\r\n",
      "at once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and\r\n",
      "afterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with\r\n",
      "their uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous\r\n",
      "opinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in his younger years,\r\n",
      "and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too\r\n",
      "rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to\r\n",
      "predict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with\r\n",
      "benevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as\r\n",
      "possible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite\r\n",
      "minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax\r\n",
      "about all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box,\r\n",
      "concerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in\r\n",
      "abeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and\r\n",
      "virtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle’s talk or his\r\n",
      "way of “letting things be” on his estate, and making her long all the\r\n",
      "more for the time when she would be of age and have some command of\r\n",
      "money for generous schemes. She was regarded as an heiress; for not\r\n",
      "only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but\r\n",
      "if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s\r\n",
      "estate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which\r\n",
      "seemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late\r\n",
      "conduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and\r\n",
      "of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities\r\n",
      "of genteel life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such\r\n",
      "prospects? Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her\r\n",
      "insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a\r\n",
      "wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead\r\n",
      "her at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and\r\n",
      "fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick\r\n",
      "laborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the\r\n",
      "time of the Apostles—who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist,\r\n",
      "and of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife\r\n",
      "might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the\r\n",
      "application of her income which would interfere with political economy\r\n",
      "and the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice\r\n",
      "before he risked himself in such fellowship. Women were expected to\r\n",
      "have weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic\r\n",
      "life was, that opinions were not acted on. Sane people did what their\r\n",
      "neighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know\r\n",
      "and avoid them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers,\r\n",

      "innocent-looking, while Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her\r\n",
      "religion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with her,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by\r\n",
      "this alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably\r\n",
      "reconcilable with it. Most men thought her bewitching when she was on\r\n",
      "horseback. She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the\r\n",
      "country, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she\r\n",
      "looked very little like a devotee. Riding was an indulgence which she\r\n",
      "allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she\r\n",
      "enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to\r\n",
      "renouncing it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it\r\n",
      "was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with\r\n",
      "attractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman\r\n",
      "appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of\r\n",
      "seeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia:\r\n",
      "Sir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from\r\n",
      "Celia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for\r\n",
      "Celia to accept him. That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself\r\n",
      "would have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all\r\n",
      "her eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas\r\n",
      "about marriage. She felt sure that she would have accepted the\r\n",
      "judicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that\r\n",
      "wretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his\r\n",
      "blindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits\r\n",
      "it would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome\r\n",
      "baronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she expressed\r\n",
      "uncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover? The really delightful\r\n",

      "could teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.\r\n",

      "such a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s\r\n",
      "objections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world—that is\r\n",
      "to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife, and the small group of\r\n",
      "gentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire. So\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke presided in her uncle’s household, and did not at all\r\n",
      "dislike her new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another\r\n",
      "gentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt\r\n",
      "some venerating expectation. This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon,\r\n",
      "noted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many\r\n",
      "years to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also\r\n",
      "as a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety, and having views\r\n",
      "of his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication\r\n",
      "of his book. His very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be\r\n",
      "measured without a precise chronology of scholarship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she\r\n",
      "had set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the\r\n",
      "pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on\r\n",
      "finishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted\r\n",
      "in), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to\r\n",
      "propose something, said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we\r\n",
      "looked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them? It is exactly six\r\n",
      "months to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at\r\n",
      "them yet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full\r\n",
      "presence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and\r\n",
      "principle; two associated facts which might show a mysterious\r\n",
      "electricity if you touched them incautiously. To her relief, Dorothea’s\r\n",
      "eyes were full of laughter as she looked up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia! Is it six calendar or\r\n",
      "six lunar months?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April\r\n",
      "when uncle gave them to you. You know, he said that he had forgotten\r\n",
      "them till then. I believe you have never thought of them since you\r\n",
      "locked them up in the cabinet here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea spoke in a\r\n",
      "full cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. She had her pencil\r\n",
      "in her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia colored, and looked very grave. “I think, dear, we are wanting in\r\n",
      "respect to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no notice of them.\r\n",
      "And,” she added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of\r\n",
      "mortification, “necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who\r\n",
      "was stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.\r\n",
      "And Christians generally—surely there are women in heaven now who wore\r\n",
      "jewels.” Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she really\r\n",
      "applied herself to argument.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished\r\n",
      "discovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she\r\n",
      "had caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments. “Of\r\n",
      "course, then, let us have them out. Why did you not tell me before? But\r\n",
      "the keys, the keys!” She pressed her hands against the sides of her\r\n",
      "head and seemed to despair of her memory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long\r\n",
      "meditated and prearranged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread\r\n",
      "out, making a bright parterre on the table. It was no great collection,\r\n",
      "but a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest\r\n",
      "that was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in\r\n",
      "exquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.\r\n",
      "Dorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened it round her\r\n",
      "sister’s neck, where it fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the\r\n",
      "circle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Celia’s head and neck, and\r\n",
      "she could see that it did, in the pier-glass opposite.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But this\r\n",
      "cross you must wear with your dark dresses.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia was trying not to smile with pleasure. “O Dodo, you must keep the\r\n",
      "cross yourself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless\r\n",
      "deprecation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress, now,”\r\n",
      "said Celia, insistingly. “You _might_ wear that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing I\r\n",
      "would wear as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek. “Souls have\r\n",
      "complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I am so\r\n",
      "fond of—plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear. We need\r\n",
      "discuss them no longer. There—take away your property.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of superiority\r\n",
      "in this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of\r\n",
      "an unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will\r\n",
      "never wear them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to\r\n",
      "keep you in countenance. If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I\r\n",
      "should feel as if I had been pirouetting. The world would go round with\r\n",
      "me, and I should not know how to walk.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off. “It would be a\r\n",
      "little tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit\r\n",
      "you better,” she said, with some satisfaction. The complete unfitness\r\n",
      "of the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Celia\r\n",
      "happier in taking it. She was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed\r\n",
      "a fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a\r\n",
      "cloud sent a bright gleam over the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new current\r\n",
      "of feeling, as sudden as the gleam. “It is strange how deeply colors\r\n",
      "seem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why\r\n",
      "gems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. They\r\n",
      "look like fragments of heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful\r\n",
      "than any of them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia. “We did not notice\r\n",
      "this at first.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her\r\n",
      "finely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on\r\n",
      "a level with her eyes. All the while her thought was trying to justify\r\n",
      "her delight in the colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You _would_ like those, Dorothea,” said Celia, rather falteringly,\r\n",
      "beginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness,\r\n",
      "and also that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than\r\n",
      "purple amethysts. “You must keep that ring and bracelet—if nothing\r\n",
      "else. But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes! I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea. Then,\r\n",
      "letting her hand fall on the table, she said in another tone—“Yet what\r\n",
      "miserable men find such things, and work at them, and sell them!” She\r\n",
      "paused again, and Celia thought that her sister was going to renounce\r\n",
      "the ornaments, as in consistency she ought to do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly. “But take all\r\n",
      "the rest away, and the casket.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking\r\n",
      "at them. She thought of often having them by her, to feed her eye at\r\n",
      "these little fountains of pure color.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching her with\r\n",
      "real curiosity as to what she would do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her imaginative\r\n",
      "adornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen\r\n",
      "discernment, which was not without a scorching quality. If Miss Brooke\r\n",
      "ever attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward\r\n",
      "fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps,” she said, rather haughtily. “I cannot tell to what level I\r\n",
      "may sink.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia blushed, and was unhappy: she saw that she had offended her\r\n",
      "sister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the\r\n",
      "ornaments which she put back into the box and carried away. Dorothea\r\n",
      "too was unhappy, as she went on with her plan-drawing, questioning the\r\n",
      "purity of her own feeling and speech in the scene which had ended with\r\n",
      "that little explosion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia’s consciousness told her that she had not been at all in the\r\n",
      "wrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she should have asked\r\n",
      "that question, and she repeated to herself that Dorothea was\r\n",
      "inconsistent: either she should have taken her full share of the\r\n",
      "jewels, or, after what she had said, she should have renounced them\r\n",
      "altogether.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure—at least, I trust,” thought Celia, “that the wearing of a\r\n",
      "necklace will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see that I\r\n",
      "should be bound by Dorothea’s opinions now we are going into society,\r\n",
      "though of course she herself ought to be bound by them. But Dorothea is\r\n",
      "not always consistent.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus Celia, mutely bending over her tapestry, until she heard her\r\n",
      "sister calling her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great\r\n",
      "architect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Celia bent over the paper, Dorothea put her cheek against her\r\n",
      "sister’s arm caressingly. Celia understood the action. Dorothea saw\r\n",
      "that she had been in the wrong, and Celia pardoned her. Since they\r\n",
      "could remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in the\r\n",
      "attitude of Celia’s mind towards her elder sister. The younger had\r\n",
      "always worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private\r\n",
      "opinions?\r\n",

      "caballo rucio rodado que trae puesto en la cabeza un yelmo de oro?’ ‘Lo\r\n",
      "que veo y columbro,’ respondio Sancho, ‘no es sino un hombre sobre un\r\n",

      "“Sir Humphry Davy?” said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in his easy smiling\r\n",
      "way, taking up Sir James Chettam’s remark that he was studying Davy’s\r\n",
      "Agricultural Chemistry. “Well, now, Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him\r\n",
      "years ago at Cartwright’s, and Wordsworth was there too—the poet\r\n",
      "Wordsworth, you know. Now there was something singular. I was at\r\n",
      "Cambridge when Wordsworth was there, and I never met him—and I dined\r\n",
      "with him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright’s. There’s an oddity in\r\n",
      "things, now. But Davy was there: he was a poet too. Or, as I may say,\r\n",
      "Wordsworth was poet one, and Davy was poet two. That was true in every\r\n",
      "sense, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual. In the beginning of\r\n",
      "dinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the\r\n",
      "mass of a magistrate’s mind fell too noticeably. She wondered how a man\r\n",
      "like Mr. Casaubon would support such triviality. His manners, she\r\n",
      "thought, were very dignified; the set of his iron-gray hair and his\r\n",
      "deep eye-sockets made him resemble the portrait of Locke. He had the\r\n",
      "spare form and the pale complexion which became a student; as different\r\n",
      "as possible from the blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type\r\n",
      "represented by Sir James Chettam.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry,” said this excellent baronet,\r\n",
      "“because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see\r\n",
      "if something cannot be done in setting a good pattern of farming among\r\n",
      "my tenants. Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A great mistake, Chettam,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “going into\r\n",
      "electrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of\r\n",
      "your cow-house. It won’t do. I went into science a great deal myself at\r\n",
      "one time; but I saw it would not do. It leads to everything; you can\r\n",
      "let nothing alone. No, no—see that your tenants don’t sell their straw,\r\n",
      "and that kind of thing; and give them draining-tiles, you know. But\r\n",
      "your fancy farming will not do—the most expensive sort of whistle you\r\n",
      "can buy: you may as well keep a pack of hounds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Surely,” said Dorothea, “it is better to spend money in finding out\r\n",
      "how men can make the most of the land which supports them all, than in\r\n",
      "keeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it. It is not a sin to make\r\n",
      "yourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir\r\n",
      "James had appealed to her. He was accustomed to do so, and she had\r\n",
      "often thought that she could urge him to many good actions when he was\r\n",
      "her brother-in-law.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon turned his eyes very markedly on Dorothea while she was\r\n",
      "speaking, and seemed to observe her newly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Young ladies don’t understand political economy, you know,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke, smiling towards Mr. Casaubon. “I remember when we were all\r\n",
      "reading Adam Smith. _There_ is a book, now. I took in all the new ideas\r\n",
      "at one time—human perfectibility, now. But some say, history moves in\r\n",
      "circles; and that may be very well argued; I have argued it myself. The\r\n",
      "fact is, human reason may carry you a little too far—over the hedge, in\r\n",
      "fact. It carried me a good way at one time; but I saw it would not do.\r\n",
      "I pulled up; I pulled up in time. But not too hard. I have always been\r\n",
      "in favor of a little theory: we must have Thought; else we shall be\r\n",
      "landed back in the dark ages. But talking of books, there is Southey’s\r\n",
      "‘Peninsular War.’ I am reading that of a morning. You know Southey?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Mr. Casaubon, not keeping pace with Mr. Brooke’s impetuous\r\n",
      "reason, and thinking of the book only. “I have little leisure for such\r\n",
      "literature just now. I have been using up my eyesight on old characters\r\n",
      "lately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I am\r\n",
      "fastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect\r\n",
      "reader. It is a misfortune, in some senses: I feed too much on the\r\n",
      "inward sources; I live too much with the dead. My mind is something\r\n",
      "like the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying\r\n",
      "mentally to construct it as it used to be, in spite of ruin and\r\n",
      "confusing changes. But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution\r\n",
      "about my eyesight.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. He\r\n",
      "delivered himself with precision, as if he had been called upon to make\r\n",
      "a public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his speech,\r\n",
      "occasionally corresponded to by a movement of his head, was the more\r\n",
      "conspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke’s scrappy\r\n",
      "slovenliness. Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most\r\n",
      "interesting man she had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret,\r\n",
      "the Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the\r\n",
      "Waldenses. To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the\r\n",
      "highest purposes of truth—what a work to be in any way present at, to\r\n",
      "assist in, though only as a lamp-holder! This elevating thought lifted\r\n",
      "her above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of\r\n",
      "political economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an\r\n",
      "extinguisher over all her lights.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you are fond of riding, Miss Brooke,” Sir James presently took an\r\n",
      "opportunity of saying. “I should have thought you would enter a little\r\n",
      "into the pleasures of hunting. I wish you would let me send over a\r\n",
      "chestnut horse for you to try. It has been trained for a lady. I saw\r\n",
      "you on Saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you. My\r\n",
      "groom shall bring Corydon for you every day, if you will only mention\r\n",
      "the time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you, you are very good. I mean to give up riding. I shall not\r\n",
      "ride any more,” said Dorothea, urged to this brusque resolution by a\r\n",
      "little annoyance that Sir James would be soliciting her attention when\r\n",
      "she wanted to give it all to Mr. Casaubon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, that is too hard,” said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that\r\n",
      "showed strong interest. “Your sister is given to self-mortification, is\r\n",
      "she not?” he continued, turning to Celia, who sat at his right hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think she is,” said Celia, feeling afraid lest she should say\r\n",
      "something that would not please her sister, and blushing as prettily as\r\n",
      "possible above her necklace. “She likes giving up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not\r\n",
      "self-mortification. But there may be good reasons for choosing not to\r\n",
      "do what is very agreeable,” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon was observing Dorothea, and she was aware of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Exactly,” said Sir James. “You give up from some high, generous\r\n",
      "motive.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed, not exactly. I did not say that of myself,” answered\r\n",
      "Dorothea, reddening. Unlike Celia, she rarely blushed, and only from\r\n",
      "high delight or anger. At this moment she felt angry with the perverse\r\n",
      "Sir James. Why did he not pay attention to Celia, and leave her to\r\n",
      "listen to Mr. Casaubon?—if that learned man would only talk, instead of\r\n",
      "allowing himself to be talked to by Mr. Brooke, who was just then\r\n",
      "informing him that the Reformation either meant something or it did\r\n",
      "not, that he himself was a Protestant to the core, but that Catholicism\r\n",
      "was a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a Romanist\r\n",
      "chapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly\r\n",
      "speaking, was the dread of a Hereafter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I made a great study of theology at one time,” said Mr. Brooke, as if\r\n",
      "to explain the insight just manifested. “I know something of all\r\n",
      "schools. I knew Wilberforce in his best days. Do you know Wilberforce?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon said, “No.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker; but if I went\r\n",
      "into Parliament, as I have been asked to do, I should sit on the\r\n",
      "independent bench, as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon bowed, and observed that it was a wide field.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, with an easy smile, “but I have documents. I\r\n",
      "began a long while ago to collect documents. They want arranging, but\r\n",
      "when a question has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an\r\n",
      "answer. I have documents at my back. But now, how do you arrange your\r\n",
      "documents?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In pigeon-holes partly,” said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air\r\n",
      "of effort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, pigeon-holes will not do. I have tried pigeon-holes, but\r\n",
      "everything gets mixed in pigeon-holes: I never know whether a paper is\r\n",
      "in A or Z.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle,” said\r\n",
      "Dorothea. “I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects\r\n",
      "under each letter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, “You have\r\n",
      "an excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies\r\n",
      "meddle with my documents. Young ladies are too flighty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that her uncle had some\r\n",
      "special reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in\r\n",
      "his mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other\r\n",
      "fragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Celia! He is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw. He\r\n",
      "is remarkably like the portrait of Locke. He has the same deep\r\n",
      "eye-sockets.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I dare say! when people of a certain sort looked at him,” said\r\n",
      "Dorothea, walking away a little.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Casaubon is so sallow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All the better. I suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a\r\n",
      "_cochon de lait_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dodo!” exclaimed Celia, looking after her in surprise. “I never heard\r\n",
      "you make such a comparison before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should I make it before the occasion came? It is a good\r\n",
      "comparison: the match is perfect.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke was clearly forgetting herself, and Celia thought so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wonder you show temper, Dorothea.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is so painful in you, Celia, that you will look at human beings as\r\n",
      "if they were merely animals with a toilet, and never see the great soul\r\n",
      "in a man’s face.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul?” Celia was not without a touch of naive\r\n",
      "malice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I believe he has,” said Dorothea, with the full voice of\r\n",
      "decision. “Everything I see in him corresponds to his pamphlet on\r\n",
      "Biblical Cosmology.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He talks very little,” said Celia\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is no one for him to talk to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia thought privately, “Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam; I\r\n",
      "believe she would not accept him.” Celia felt that this was a pity. She\r\n",
      "had never been deceived as to the object of the baronet’s interest.\r\n",
      "Sometimes, indeed, she had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a\r\n",
      "husband happy who had not her way of looking at things; and stifled in\r\n",
      "the depths of her heart was the feeling that her sister was too\r\n",
      "religious for family comfort. Notions and scruples were like spilt\r\n",
      "needles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even\r\n",
      "eating.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Miss Brooke was at the tea-table, Sir James came to sit down by\r\n",
      "her, not having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive. Why\r\n",
      "should he? He thought it probable that Miss Brooke liked him, and\r\n",
      "manners must be very marked indeed before they cease to be interpreted\r\n",
      "by preconceptions either confident or distrustful. She was thoroughly\r\n",
      "charming to him, but of course he theorized a little about his\r\n",
      "attachment. He was made of excellent human dough, and had the rare\r\n",
      "merit of knowing that his talents, even if let loose, would not set the\r\n",
      "smallest stream in the county on fire: hence he liked the prospect of a\r\n",
      "wife to whom he could say, “What shall we do?” about this or that; who\r\n",
      "could help her husband out with reasons, and would also have the\r\n",
      "property qualification for doing so. As to the excessive religiousness\r\n",
      "alleged against Miss Brooke, he had a very indefinite notion of what it\r\n",
      "consisted in, and thought that it would die out with marriage. In\r\n",
      "short, he felt himself to be in love in the right place, and was ready\r\n",
      "to endure a great deal of predominance, which, after all, a man could\r\n",
      "always put down when he liked. Sir James had no idea that he should\r\n",
      "ever like to put down the predominance of this handsome girl, in whose\r\n",
      "cleverness he delighted. Why not? A man’s mind—what there is of it—has\r\n",
      "always the advantage of being masculine,—as the smallest birch-tree is\r\n",
      "of a higher kind than the most soaring palm,—and even his ignorance is\r\n",
      "of a sounder quality. Sir James might not have originated this\r\n",
      "estimate; but a kind Providence furnishes the limpest personality with\r\n",
      "a little gum or starch in the form of tradition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse,\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke,” said the persevering admirer. “I assure you, riding is\r\n",
      "the most healthy of exercises.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am aware of it,” said Dorothea, coldly. “I think it would do Celia\r\n",
      "good—if she would take to it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you are such a perfect horsewoman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me; I have had very little practice, and I should be easily\r\n",
      "thrown.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then that is a reason for more practice. Every lady ought to be a\r\n",
      "perfect horsewoman, that she may accompany her husband.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that I\r\n",
      "ought not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never correspond\r\n",
      "to your pattern of a lady.” Dorothea looked straight before her, and\r\n",
      "spoke with cold brusquerie, very much with the air of a handsome boy,\r\n",
      "in amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of her admirer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should like to know your reasons for this cruel resolution. It is\r\n",
      "not possible that you should think horsemanship wrong.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is quite possible that I should think it wrong for me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, why?” said Sir James, in a tender tone of remonstrance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon had come up to the table, teacup in hand, and was\r\n",
      "listening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We must not inquire too curiously into motives,” he interposed, in his\r\n",
      "measured way. “Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in\r\n",
      "the utterance: the aroma is mixed with the grosser air. We must keep\r\n",
      "the germinating grain away from the light.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea colored with pleasure, and looked up gratefully to the\r\n",
      "speaker. Here was a man who could understand the higher inward life,\r\n",
      "and with whom there could be some spiritual communion; nay, who could\r\n",
      "illuminate principle with the widest knowledge: a man whose learning\r\n",
      "almost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s inferences may seem large; but really life could never have\r\n",
      "gone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions,\r\n",
      "which has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization.\r\n",
      "Has any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of\r\n",
      "pre-matrimonial acquaintanceship?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly,” said good Sir James. “Miss Brooke shall not be urged to\r\n",
      "tell reasons she would rather be silent upon. I am sure her reasons\r\n",
      "would do her honor.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had\r\n",
      "looked up at Mr. Casaubon: it never occurred to him that a girl to whom\r\n",
      "he was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm\r\n",
      "towards fifty, except, indeed, in a religious sort of way, as for a\r\n",
      "clergyman of some distinction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, since Miss Brooke had become engaged in a conversation with\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon about the Vaudois clergy, Sir James betook himself to\r\n",
      "Celia, and talked to her about her sister; spoke of a house in town,\r\n",
      "and asked whether Miss Brooke disliked London. Away from her sister,\r\n",
      "Celia talked quite easily, and Sir James said to himself that the\r\n",
      "second Miss Brooke was certainly very agreeable as well as pretty,\r\n",
      "though not, as some people pretended, more clever and sensible than the\r\n",
      "elder sister. He felt that he had chosen the one who was in all\r\n",
      "respects the superior; and a man naturally likes to look forward to\r\n",
      "having the best. He would be the very Mawworm of bachelors who\r\n",
      "pretended not to expect it.\r\n",

      "If it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss Brooke as a\r\n",
      "suitable wife for him, the reasons that might induce her to accept him\r\n",
      "were already planted in her mind, and by the evening of the next day\r\n",
      "the reasons had budded and bloomed. For they had had a long\r\n",
      "conversation in the morning, while Celia, who did not like the company\r\n",
      "of Mr. Casaubon’s moles and sallowness, had escaped to the vicarage to\r\n",
      "play with the curate’s ill-shod but merry children.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon’s mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine\r\n",
      "extension every quality she herself brought; had opened much of her own\r\n",
      "experience to him, and had understood from him the scope of his great\r\n",
      "work, also of attractively labyrinthine extent. For he had been as\r\n",
      "instructive as Milton’s “affable archangel;” and with something of the\r\n",
      "archangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show (what\r\n",
      "indeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness,\r\n",
      "justice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon aimed) that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical\r\n",
      "fragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally\r\n",
      "revealed. Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm\r\n",
      "footing there, the vast field of mythical constructions became\r\n",
      "intelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of\r\n",
      "correspondences. But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no\r\n",
      "light or speedy work. His notes already made a formidable range of\r\n",
      "volumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous\r\n",
      "still-accumulating results and bring them, like the earlier vintage of\r\n",
      "Hippocratic books, to fit a little shelf. In explaining this to\r\n",
      "Dorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed himself nearly as he would have done\r\n",
      "to a fellow-student, for he had not two styles of talking at command:\r\n",
      "it is true that when he used a Greek or Latin phrase he always gave the\r\n",
      "English with scrupulous care, but he would probably have done this in\r\n",
      "any case. A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his\r\n",
      "acquaintances as of “lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men,\r\n",
      "that conne Latyn but lytille.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this\r\n",
      "conception. Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies’ school\r\n",
      "literature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile\r\n",
      "complete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine who\r\n",
      "united the glories of doctor and saint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning, for when\r\n",
      "Dorothea was impelled to open her mind on certain themes which she\r\n",
      "could speak of to no one whom she had before seen at Tipton, especially\r\n",
      "on the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of\r\n",
      "belief compared with that spiritual religion, that submergence of self\r\n",
      "in communion with Divine perfection which seemed to her to be expressed\r\n",
      "in the best Christian books of widely distant ages, she found in Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon a listener who understood her at once, who could assure her of\r\n",
      "his own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise\r\n",
      "conformity, and could mention historical examples before unknown to\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He thinks with me,” said Dorothea to herself, “or rather, he thinks a\r\n",
      "whole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror. And his\r\n",
      "feelings too, his whole experience—what a lake compared with my little\r\n",
      "pool!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly\r\n",
      "than other young ladies of her age. Signs are small measurable things,\r\n",
      "but interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent\r\n",
      "nature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a\r\n",
      "sky, and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of\r\n",
      "knowledge. They are not always too grossly deceived; for Sinbad himself\r\n",
      "may have fallen by good-luck on a true description, and wrong reasoning\r\n",
      "sometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions: starting a long way\r\n",
      "off the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we now and\r\n",
      "then arrive just where we ought to be. Because Miss Brooke was hasty in\r\n",

      "invitation from Mr. Brooke, who offered no bait except his own\r\n",
      "documents on machine-breaking and rick-burning. Mr. Casaubon was called\r\n",
      "into the library to look at these in a heap, while his host picked up\r\n",
      "first one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and\r\n",
      "uncertain way, passing from one unfinished passage to another with a\r\n",
      "“Yes, now, but here!” and finally pushing them all aside to open the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Look here—here is all about Greece. Rhamnus, the ruins of Rhamnus—you\r\n",

      "study to the topography. I spent no end of time in making out these\r\n",
      "things—Helicon, now. Here, now!—‘We started the next morning for\r\n",
      "Parnassus, the double-peaked Parnassus.’ All this volume is about\r\n",
      "Greece, you know,” Mr. Brooke wound up, rubbing his thumb transversely\r\n",
      "along the edges of the leaves as he held the book forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience; bowed in\r\n",
      "the right place, and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as\r\n",
      "possible, without showing disregard or impatience; mindful that this\r\n",
      "desultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country, and\r\n",
      "that the man who took him on this severe mental scamper was not only an\r\n",
      "amiable host, but a landholder and custos rotulorum. Was his endurance\r\n",
      "aided also by the reflection that Mr. Brooke was the uncle of Dorothea?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certainly he seemed more and more bent on making her talk to him, on\r\n",
      "drawing her out, as Celia remarked to herself; and in looking at her\r\n",
      "his face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine. Before\r\n",
      "he left the next morning, while taking a pleasant walk with Miss Brooke\r\n",
      "along the gravelled terrace, he had mentioned to her that he felt the\r\n",
      "disadvantage of loneliness, the need of that cheerful companionship\r\n",
      "with which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils\r\n",
      "of maturity. And he delivered this statement with as much careful\r\n",
      "precision as if he had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be\r\n",
      "attended with results. Indeed, Mr. Casaubon was not used to expect that\r\n",
      "he should have to repeat or revise his communications of a practical or\r\n",
      "personal kind. The inclinations which he had deliberately stated on the\r\n",
      "2d of October he would think it enough to refer to by the mention of\r\n",
      "that date; judging by the standard of his own memory, which was a\r\n",
      "volume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions, and not\r\n",
      "the ordinary long-used blotting-book which only tells of forgotten\r\n",
      "writing. But in this case Mr. Casaubon’s confidence was not likely to\r\n",
      "be falsified, for Dorothea heard and retained what he said with the\r\n",
      "eager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in\r\n",
      "experience is an epoch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was three o’clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from\r\n",
      "Tipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along\r\n",
      "the shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the\r\n",
      "bordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk,\r\n",
      "the Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in\r\n",

      "her straw bonnet (which our contemporaries might look at with\r\n",

      "backward. She would perhaps be hardly characterized enough if it were\r\n",
      "omitted that she wore her brown hair flatly braided and coiled behind\r\n",
      "so as to expose the outline of her head in a daring manner at a time\r\n",
      "when public feeling required the meagreness of nature to be\r\n",

      "spontaneous trust ought to be. Miss Pippin adoring young Pumpkin, and\r\n",
      "dreaming along endless vistas of unwearying companionship, was a little\r\n",

      "all costumes. Let but Pumpkin have a figure which would sustain the\r\n",
      "disadvantages of the shortwaisted swallow-tail, and everybody felt it\r\n",

      "a sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions\r\n",
      "about marriage took their color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm\r\n",
      "about the ends of life, an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its own\r\n",

      "contentment poor Dorothea was shut out. The intensity of her religious\r\n",
      "disposition, the coercion it exercised over her life, was but one\r\n",
      "aspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic, and intellectually\r\n",
      "consequent: and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow\r\n",

      "admission of rules which were never acted on. Into this soul-hunger as\r\n",
      "yet all her youthful passion was poured; the union which attracted her\r\n",
      "was one that would deliver her from her girlish subjection to her own\r\n",

      "the greatest things. It would be like marrying Pascal. I should learn\r\n",

      "any inward effort to change the direction of her thoughts by the\r\n",
      "appearance of a cantering horseman round a turning of the road. The\r\n",
      "well-groomed chestnut horse and two beautiful setters could leave no\r\n",

      "Miss Brooke was annoyed at the interruption. This amiable baronet,\r\n",

      "too good an understanding with you, and agreeing with you even when you\r\n",

      "addresses to herself could not take shape: all her mental activity was\r\n",
      "used up in persuasions of another kind. But he was positively obtrusive\r\n",
      "at this moment, and his dimpled hands were quite disagreeable. Her\r\n",

      "Maltese puppy, one of nature’s most naive toys.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is painful to me to see these creatures that are bred merely as\r\n",

      "(as opinions will) under the heat of irritation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I believe all the petting that is given them does not make them happy.\r\n",
      "They are too helpless: their lives are too frail. A weasel or a mouse\r\n",
      "that gets its own living is more interesting. I like to think that the\r\n",
      "animals about us have souls something like our own, and either carry on\r\n",
      "their own little affairs or can be companions to us, like Monk here.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The objectionable puppy, whose nose and eyes were equally black and\r\n",
      "expressive, was thus got rid of, since Miss Brooke decided that it had\r\n",
      "better not have been born. But she felt it necessary to explain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must not judge of Celia’s feeling from mine. I think she likes\r\n",

      "rather short-sighted.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have your own opinion about everything, Miss Brooke, and it is\r\n",

      "What answer was possible to such stupid complimenting?\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“On the contrary, I am often unable to decide. But that is from\r\n",
      "ignorance. The right conclusion is there all the same, though I am\r\n",
      "unable to see it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "thought. You had a real _genus_, to use his expression. He said you\r\n",
      "wanted Mr. Brooke to build a new set of cottages, but he seemed to\r\n",
      "think it hardly probable that your uncle would consent. Do you know,\r\n",
      "that is one of the things I wish to do—I mean, on my own estate. I\r\n",
      "should be so glad to carry out that plan of yours, if you would let me\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "our beautiful houses with a scourge of small cords—all of us who let\r\n",
      "tenants live in such sties as we see round us. Life in cottages might\r\n",

      "examining all the plans for cottages in Loudon’s book, and picked out\r\n",
      "what seem the best things. Oh what a happiness it would be to set the\r\n",
      "pattern about here! I think instead of Lazarus at the gate, we should\r\n",
      "put the pigsty cottages outside the park-gate.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was in the best temper now. Sir James, as brother in-law,\r\n",
      "building model cottages on his estate, and then, perhaps, others being\r\n",
      "built at Lowick, and more and more elsewhere in imitation—it would be\r\n",
      "as if the spirit of Oberlin had passed over the parishes to make the\r\n",
      "life of poverty beautiful!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James saw all the plans, and took one away to consult upon with\r\n",
      "Lovegood. He also took away a complacent sense that he was making great\r\n",
      "progress in Miss Brooke’s good opinion. The Maltese puppy was not\r\n",
      "offered to Celia; an omission which Dorothea afterwards thought of with\r\n",

      "James. After all, it was a relief that there was no puppy to tread\r\n",
      "upon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia was present while the plans were being examined, and observed Sir\r\n",

      "laying herself open to a demonstration that she was somehow or other at\r\n",
      "war with all goodness. But on safe opportunities, she had an indirect\r\n",
      "mode of making her negative wisdom tell upon Dorothea, and calling her\r\n",
      "down from her rhapsodic mood by reminding her that people were staring,\r\n",
      "not listening. Celia was not impulsive: what she had to say could wait,\r\n",
      "and came from her always with the same quiet staccato evenness. When\r\n",
      "people talked with energy and emphasis she watched their faces and\r\n",
      "features merely. She never could understand how well-bred persons\r\n",

      "It was not many days before Mr. Casaubon paid a morning visit, on which\r\n",
      "he was invited again for the following week to dine and stay the night.\r\n",
      "Thus Dorothea had three more conversations with him, and was convinced\r\n",
      "that her first impressions had been just. He was all she had at first\r\n",
      "imagined him to be: almost everything he had said seemed like a\r\n",
      "specimen from a mine, or the inscription on the door of a museum which\r\n",
      "might open on the treasures of past ages; and this trust in his mental\r\n",
      "wealth was all the deeper and more effective on her inclination because\r\n",
      "it was now obvious that his visits were made for her sake. This\r\n",
      "accomplished man condescended to think of a young girl, and take the\r\n",
      "pains to talk to her, not with absurd compliment, but with an appeal to\r\n",
      "her understanding, and sometimes with instructive correction. What\r\n",
      "delightful companionship! Mr. Casaubon seemed even unconscious that\r\n",
      "trivialities existed, and never handed round that small-talk of heavy\r\n",
      "men which is as acceptable as stale bride-cake brought forth with an\r\n",
      "odor of cupboard. He talked of what he was interested in, or else he\r\n",
      "was silent and bowed with sad civility. To Dorothea this was adorable\r\n",
      "genuineness, and religious abstinence from that artificiality which\r\n",
      "uses up the soul in the efforts of pretence. For she looked as\r\n",
      "reverently at Mr. Casaubon’s religious elevation above herself as she\r\n",
      "did at his intellect and learning. He assented to her expressions of\r\n",
      "devout feeling, and usually with an appropriate quotation; he allowed\r\n",
      "himself to say that he had gone through some spiritual conflicts in his\r\n",
      "youth; in short, Dorothea saw that here she might reckon on\r\n",
      "understanding, sympathy, and guidance. On one—only one—of her favorite\r\n",
      "themes she was disappointed. Mr. Casaubon apparently did not care about\r\n",
      "building cottages, and diverted the talk to the extremely narrow\r\n",
      "accommodation which was to be had in the dwellings of the ancient\r\n",
      "Egyptians, as if to check a too high standard. After he was gone,\r\n",
      "Dorothea dwelt with some agitation on this indifference of his; and her\r\n",
      "mind was much exercised with arguments drawn from the varying\r\n",
      "conditions of climate which modify human needs, and from the admitted\r\n",
      "wickedness of pagan despots. Should she not urge these arguments on Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon when he came again? But further reflection told her that she\r\n",
      "was presumptuous in demanding his attention to such a subject; he would\r\n",
      "not disapprove of her occupying herself with it in leisure moments, as\r\n",
      "other women expected to occupy themselves with their dress and\r\n",
      "embroidery—would not forbid it when—Dorothea felt rather ashamed as she\r\n",
      "detected herself in these speculations. But her uncle had been invited\r\n",
      "to go to Lowick to stay a couple of days: was it reasonable to suppose\r\n",

      "either with or without documents?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile that little disappointment made her delight the more in Sir\r\n",
      "James Chettam’s readiness to set on foot the desired improvements. He\r\n",
      "came much oftener than Mr. Casaubon, and Dorothea ceased to find him\r\n",
      "disagreeable since he showed himself so entirely in earnest; for he had\r\n",
      "already entered with much practical ability into Lovegood’s estimates,\r\n",
      "and was charmingly docile. She proposed to build a couple of cottages,\r\n",
      "and transfer two families from their old cabins, which could then be\r\n",

      "whether there was or was not a little wilfulness in her continuing\r\n",
      "blind to the possibility that another sort of choice was in question in\r\n",

      "it is impossible to satisfy you; yet you never see what is quite plain.\r\n",
      "That’s your way, Dodo.” Something certainly gave Celia unusual courage;\r\n",

      "nullifidian, worse than any discouraging presence in the “Pilgrim’s\r\n",

      "withered up into such parched rubbish as that? When she got out of the\r\n",

      "sorrow, and her uncle who met her in the hall would have been alarmed,\r\n",

      "excessive religiousness. He had returned, during their absence, from a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It seemed as if an electric stream went through Dorothea, thrilling her\r\n",
      "from despair into expectation. They were pamphlets about the early\r\n",
      "Church. The oppression of Celia, Tantripp, and Sir James was shaken\r\n",
      "off, and she walked straight to the library. Celia went up-stairs. Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke was detained by a message, but when he re-entered the library,\r\n",
      "he found Dorothea seated and already deep in one of the pamphlets which\r\n",
      "had some marginal manuscript of Mr. Casaubon’s,—taking it in as eagerly\r\n",
      "as she might have taken in the scent of a fresh bouquet after a dry,\r\n",
      "hot, dreary walk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Mr. Brooke sat down in his arm-chair, stretched his legs towards the\r\n",
      "wood-fire, which had fallen into a wondrous mass of glowing dice\r\n",
      "between the dogs, and rubbed his hands gently, looking very mildly\r\n",
      "towards Dorothea, but with a neutral leisurely air, as if he had\r\n",
      "nothing particular to say. Dorothea closed her pamphlet, as soon as she\r\n",
      "was aware of her uncle’s presence, and rose as if to go. Usually she\r\n",
      "would have been interested about her uncle’s merciful errand on behalf\r\n",
      "of the criminal, but her late agitation had made her absent-minded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I came back by Lowick, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, not as if with any\r\n",
      "intention to arrest her departure, but apparently from his usual\r\n",
      "tendency to say what he had said before. This fundamental principle of\r\n",
      "human speech was markedly exhibited in Mr. Brooke. “I lunched there and\r\n",
      "saw Casaubon’s library, and that kind of thing. There’s a sharp air,\r\n",
      "driving. Won’t you sit down, my dear? You look cold.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt quite inclined to accept the invitation. Some times, when\r\n",
      "her uncle’s easy way of taking things did not happen to be\r\n",
      "exasperating, it was rather soothing. She threw off her mantle and\r\n",
      "bonnet, and sat down opposite to him, enjoying the glow, but lifting up\r\n",
      "her beautiful hands for a screen. They were not thin hands, or small\r\n",
      "hands; but powerful, feminine, maternal hands. She seemed to be holding\r\n",
      "them up in propitiation for her passionate desire to know and to think,\r\n",
      "which in the unfriendly mediums of Tipton and Freshitt had issued in\r\n",
      "crying and red eyelids.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She bethought herself now of the condemned criminal. “What news have\r\n",
      "you brought about the sheep-stealer, uncle?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, poor Bunch?—well, it seems we can’t get him off—he is to be\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That’s true. But a man mopes, you know. I have always been a bachelor\r\n",
      "too, but I have that sort of disposition that I never moped; it was my\r\n",
      "way to go about everywhere and take in everything. I never moped: but I\r\n",
      "can see that Casaubon does, you know. He wants a companion—a companion,\r\n",
      "you know.”\r\n",

      "came to Lowick. But I never got anything out of him—any ideas, you\r\n",
      "know. However, he is a tiptop man and may be a bishop—that kind of\r\n",

      "uncommonly well—does Casaubon. He has deferred to me, you not being of\r\n",
      "age. In short, I have promised to speak to you, though I told him I\r\n",
      "thought there was not much chance. I was bound to tell him that. I\r\n",
      "said, my niece is very young, and that kind of thing. But I didn’t\r\n",
      "think it necessary to go into everything. However, the long and the\r\n",
      "short of it is, that he has asked my permission to make you an offer of\r\n",
      "marriage—of marriage, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with his explanatory\r\n",
      "nod. “I thought it better to tell you, my dear.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one could have detected any anxiety in Mr. Brooke’s manner, but he\r\n",
      "did really wish to know something of his niece’s mind, that, if there\r\n",
      "were any need for advice, he might give it in time. What feeling he, as\r\n",
      "a magistrate who had taken in so many ideas, could make room for, was\r\n",
      "unmixedly kind. Since Dorothea did not speak immediately, he repeated,\r\n",
      "“I thought it better to tell you, my dear.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you, uncle,” said Dorothea, in a clear unwavering tone. “I am\r\n",
      "very grateful to Mr. Casaubon. If he makes me an offer, I shall accept\r\n",
      "him. I admire and honor him more than any man I ever saw.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke paused a little, and then said in a lingering low tone, “Ah?\r\n",
      "… Well! He is a good match in some respects. But now, Chettam is a good\r\n",
      "match. And our land lies together. I shall never interfere against your\r\n",
      "wishes, my dear. People should have their own way in marriage, and that\r\n",
      "sort of thing—up to a certain point, you know. I have always said that,\r\n",
      "up to a certain point. I wish you to marry well; and I have good reason\r\n",
      "to believe that Chettam wishes to marry you. I mention it, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir James Chettam,” said\r\n",
      "Dorothea. “If he thinks of marrying me, he has made a great mistake.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is it, you see. One never knows. I should have thought Chettam\r\n",
      "was just the sort of man a woman would like, now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray do not mention him in that light again, uncle,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "feeling some of her late irritation revive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke wondered, and felt that women were an inexhaustible subject\r\n",
      "of study, since even he at his age was not in a perfect state of\r\n",
      "scientific prediction about them. Here was a fellow like Chettam with\r\n",
      "no chance at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, but Casaubon, now. There is no hurry—I mean for you. It’s true,\r\n",
      "every year will tell upon him. He is over five-and-forty, you know. I\r\n",
      "should say a good seven-and-twenty years older than you. To be sure,—if\r\n",
      "you like learning and standing, and that sort of thing, we can’t have\r\n",
      "everything. And his income is good—he has a handsome property\r\n",
      "independent of the Church—his income is good. Still he is not young,\r\n",
      "and I must not conceal from you, my dear, that I think his health is\r\n",
      "not over-strong. I know nothing else against him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should not wish to have a husband very near my own age,” said\r\n",

      "his niece on this occasion. “Life isn’t cast in a mould—not cut out by\r\n",
      "rule and line, and that sort of thing. I never married myself, and it\r\n",
      "will be the better for you and yours. The fact is, I never loved any\r\n",
      "one well enough to put myself into a noose for them. It _is_ a noose,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you are not fond of show, a great establishment, balls, dinners,\r\n",

      "better than Chettam’s. And you shall do as you like, my dear. I would\r\n",

      "lady; and a clergyman and scholar—who may be a bishop—that kind of\r\n",

      "good sound-hearted fellow, you know; but he doesn’t go much into ideas.\r\n",
      "I did, when I was his age. But Casaubon’s eyes, now. I think he has\r\n",

      "the announcement on Dorothea. It seemed as if something like the\r\n",
      "reflection of a white sunlit wing had passed across her features,\r\n",
      "ending in one of her rare blushes. For the first time it entered into\r\n",
      "Celia’s mind that there might be something more between Mr. Casaubon\r\n",

      "James Chettam, but the idea of marrying Mr. Casaubon! Celia felt a sort\r\n",
      "of shame mingled with a sense of the ludicrous. But perhaps Dodo, if\r\n",
      "she were really bordering on such an extravagance, might be turned away\r\n",
      "from it: experience had often shown that her impressibility might be\r\n",
      "calculated on. The day was damp, and they were not going to walk out,\r\n",
      "so they both went up to their sitting-room; and there Celia observed\r\n",
      "that Dorothea, instead of settling down with her usual diligent\r\n",
      "interest to some occupation, simply leaned her elbow on an open book\r\n",
      "and looked out of the window at the great cedar silvered with the damp.\r\n",

      "been in the house: it did not seem fair to leave her in ignorance of\r\n",
      "what would necessarily affect her attitude towards him; but it was\r\n",
      "impossible not to shrink from telling her. Dorothea accused herself of\r\n",
      "some meanness in this timidity: it was always odious to her to have any\r\n",
      "small fears or contrivances about her actions, but at this moment she\r\n",
      "was seeking the highest aid possible that she might not dread the\r\n",
      "corrosiveness of Celia’s pretty carnally minded prose. Her reverie was\r\n",
      "broken, and the difficulty of decision banished, by Celia’s small and\r\n",
      "rather guttural voice speaking in its usual tone, of a remark aside or\r\n",

      "making would have had his leg injured, but for her habitual care of\r\n",
      "whatever she held in her hands. She laid the fragile figure down at\r\n",

      "In spite of this magnanimity Dorothea was still smarting: perhaps as\r\n",
      "much from Celia’s subdued astonishment as from her small criticisms. Of\r\n",
      "course all the world round Tipton would be out of sympathy with this\r\n",

      "its best objects.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless before the evening was at an end she was very happy. In an\r\n",

      "and person so rich in the mingled graces which could render marriage\r\n",
      "desirable, was far indeed from my conception. You have all—nay, more\r\n",

      "companionable manner, though with a turn of tongue that let you know\r\n",
      "who she was. Such a lady gave a neighborliness to both rank and\r\n",

      "you: remember you are both suspicious characters since you took Peel’s\r\n",
      "side about the Catholic Bill. I shall tell everybody that you are going\r\n",
      "to put up for Middlemarch on the Whig side when old Pinkerton resigns,\r\n",

      "independent man. As to the Whigs, a man who goes with the thinkers is\r\n",
      "not likely to be hooked on by any party. He may go with them up to a\r\n",

      "where Brooke will be—there’s no counting on Brooke’—that is what people\r\n",
      "say of you, to be quite frank. Now, do turn respectable. How will you\r\n",

      "a bad conscience and an empty pocket?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t pretend to argue with a lady on politics,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\n",
      "with an air of smiling indifference, but feeling rather unpleasantly\r\n",
      "conscious that this attack of Mrs. Cadwallader’s had opened the\r\n",
      "defensive campaign to which certain rash steps had exposed him. “Your\r\n",
      "sex are not thinkers, you know—_varium et mutabile semper_—that kind of\r\n",

      "he had not had the personal acquaintance of the Augustan poet—“I was\r\n",
      "going to say, poor Stoddart, you know. That was what _he_ said. You\r\n",
      "ladies are always against an independent attitude—a man’s caring for\r\n",
      "nothing but truth, and that sort of thing. And there is no part of the\r\n",
      "county where opinion is narrower than it is here—I don’t mean to throw\r\n",
      "stones, you know, but somebody is wanted to take the independent line;\r\n",
      "and if I don’t take it, who will?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who? Why, any upstart who has got neither blood nor position. People\r\n",
      "of standing should consume their independent nonsense at home, not hawk\r\n",
      "it about. And you! who are going to marry your niece, as good as your\r\n",
      "daughter, to one of our best men. Sir James would be cruelly annoyed:\r\n",
      "it will be too hard on him if you turn round now and make yourself a\r\n",
      "Whig sign-board.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke again winced inwardly, for Dorothea’s engagement had no\r\n",
      "sooner been decided, than he had thought of Mrs. Cadwallader’s\r\n",
      "prospective taunts. It might have been easy for ignorant observers to\r\n",
      "say, “Quarrel with Mrs. Cadwallader;” but where is a country gentleman\r\n",
      "to go who quarrels with his oldest neighbors? Who could taste the fine\r\n",
      "flavor in the name of Brooke if it were delivered casually, like wine\r\n",
      "without a seal? Certainly a man can only be cosmopolitan up to a\r\n",
      "certain point.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope Chettam and I shall always be good friends; but I am sorry to\r\n",
      "say there is no prospect of his marrying my niece,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\n",
      "much relieved to see through the window that Celia was coming in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why not?” said Mrs. Cadwallader, with a sharp note of surprise. “It is\r\n",
      "hardly a fortnight since you and I were talking about it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My niece has chosen another suitor—has chosen him, you know. I have\r\n",
      "had nothing to do with it. I should have preferred Chettam; and I\r\n",
      "should have said Chettam was the man any girl would have chosen. But\r\n",
      "there is no accounting for these things. Your sex is capricious, you\r\n",
      "know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, whom do you mean to say that you are going to let her marry?”\r\n",

      "choice for Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But here Celia entered, blooming from a walk in the garden, and the\r\n",
      "greeting with her delivered Mr. Brooke from the necessity of answering\r\n",
      "immediately. He got up hastily, and saying, “By the way, I must speak\r\n",
      "to Wright about the horses,” shuffled quickly out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear child, what is this?—this about your sister’s engagement?”\r\n",

      "“She is engaged to marry Mr. Casaubon,” said Celia, resorting, as\r\n",
      "usual, to the simplest statement of fact, and enjoying this opportunity\r\n",
      "of speaking to the Rector’s wife alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is frightful. How long has it been going on?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I only knew of it yesterday. They are to be married in six weeks.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Mrs. Cadwallader, I don’t think it can be nice to marry a man with\r\n",
      "a great soul.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, my dear, take warning. You know the look of one now; when the\r\n",
      "next comes and wants to marry you, don’t you accept him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m sure I never should.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; one such in a family is enough. So your sister never cared about\r\n",

      "brother-in-law?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should have liked that very much. I am sure he would have been a\r\n",
      "good husband. Only,” Celia added, with a slight blush (she sometimes\r\n",
      "seemed to blush as she breathed), “I don’t think he would have suited\r\n",
      "Dorothea.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not high-flown enough?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dodo is very strict. She thinks so much about everything, and is so\r\n",

      "“She must have encouraged him, I am sure. That is not very creditable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "but he is so kind, he never noticed it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, putting on her shawl, and rising, as if\r\n",
      "in haste, “I must go straight to Sir James and break this to him. He\r\n",
      "will have brought his mother back by this time, and I must call. Your\r\n",
      "uncle will never tell him. We are all disappointed, my dear. Young\r\n",
      "people should think of their families in marrying. I set a bad\r\n",
      "example—married a poor clergyman, and made myself a pitiable object\r\n",
      "among the De Bracys—obliged to get my coals by stratagem, and pray to\r\n",
      "heaven for my salad oil. However, Casaubon has money enough; I must do\r\n",
      "him that justice. As to his blood, I suppose the family quarterings are\r\n",
      "three cuttle-fish sable, and a commentator rampant. By the bye, before\r\n",
      "I go, my dear, I must speak to your Mrs. Carter about pastry. I want to\r\n",
      "send my young cook to learn of her. Poor people with four children,\r\n",
      "like us, you know, can’t afford to keep a good cook. I have no doubt\r\n",
      "Mrs. Carter will oblige me. Sir James’s cook is a perfect dragon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In less than an hour, Mrs. Cadwallader had circumvented Mrs. Carter and\r\n",
      "driven to Freshitt Hall, which was not far from her own parsonage, her\r\n",
      "husband being resident in Freshitt and keeping a curate in Tipton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James Chettam had returned from the short journey which had kept\r\n",
      "him absent for a couple of days, and had changed his dress, intending\r\n",
      "to ride over to Tipton Grange. His horse was standing at the door when\r\n",
      "Mrs. Cadwallader drove up, and he immediately appeared there himself,\r\n",
      "whip in hand. Lady Chettam had not yet returned, but Mrs. Cadwallader’s\r\n",
      "errand could not be despatched in the presence of grooms, so she asked\r\n",
      "to be taken into the conservatory close by, to look at the new plants;\r\n",
      "and on coming to a contemplative stand, she said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have a great shock for you; I hope you are not so far gone in love\r\n",
      "as you pretended to be.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was of no use protesting against Mrs. Cadwallader’s way of putting\r\n",
      "things. But Sir James’s countenance changed a little. He felt a vague\r\n",
      "alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do believe Brooke is going to expose himself after all. I accused\r\n",
      "him of meaning to stand for Middlemarch on the Liberal side, and he\r\n",
      "looked silly and never denied it—talked about the independent line, and\r\n",
      "the usual nonsense.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is that all?” said Sir James, much relieved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why,” rejoined Mrs. Cadwallader, with a sharper note, “you don’t mean\r\n",
      "to say that you would like him to turn public man in that way—making a\r\n",
      "sort of political Cheap Jack of himself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He might be dissuaded, I should think. He would not like the expense.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is what I told him. He is vulnerable to reason there—always a few\r\n",
      "grains of common-sense in an ounce of miserliness. Miserliness is a\r\n",
      "capital quality to run in families; it’s the safe side for madness to\r\n",
      "dip on. And there must be a little crack in the Brooke family, else we\r\n",
      "should not see what we are to see.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What? Brooke standing for Middlemarch?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Worse than that. I really feel a little responsible. I always told you\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke would be such a fine match. I knew there was a great deal\r\n",
      "of nonsense in her—a flighty sort of Methodistical stuff. But these\r\n",
      "things wear out of girls. However, I am taken by surprise for once.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you mean, Mrs. Cadwallader?” said Sir James. His fear lest\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke should have run away to join the Moravian Brethren, or some\r\n",
      "preposterous sect unknown to good society, was a little allayed by the\r\n",
      "knowledge that Mrs. Cadwallader always made the worst of things. “What\r\n",
      "has happened to Miss Brooke? Pray speak out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well. She is engaged to be married.” Mrs. Cadwallader paused a\r\n",
      "few moments, observing the deeply hurt expression in her friend’s face,\r\n",
      "which he was trying to conceal by a nervous smile, while he whipped his\r\n",
      "boot; but she soon added, “Engaged to Casaubon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James let his whip fall and stooped to pick it up. Perhaps his face\r\n",
      "had never before gathered so much concentrated disgust as when he\r\n",
      "turned to Mrs. Cadwallader and repeated, “Casaubon?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Even so. You know my errand now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good God! It is horrible! He is no better than a mummy!” (The point of\r\n",

      "rival.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“He means to draw it out again, I suppose.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Brooke ought not to allow it: he should insist on its being put off\r\n",
      "till she is of age. She would think better of it then. What is a\r\n",
      "guardian for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "husband who attends so little to the decencies? I hide it as well as I\r\n",
      "can by abusing everybody myself. Come, come, cheer up! you are well rid\r\n",
      "of Miss Brooke, a girl who would have been requiring you to see the\r\n",
      "stars by daylight. Between ourselves, little Celia is worth two of her,\r\n",
      "and likely after all to be the better match. For this marriage to\r\n",

      "shocked and discouraged at her own stupidity, and the answers she got\r\n",

      "the fishing tackle hung. But he himself was in a little room adjoining,\r\n",
      "at work with his turning apparatus, and he called to the baronet to\r\n",
      "join him there. The two were better friends than any other landholder\r\n",
      "and clergyman in the county—a significant fact which was in agreement\r\n",
      "with the amiable expression of their faces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Cadwallader was a large man, with full lips and a sweet smile; very\r\n",
      "plain and rough in his exterior, but with that solid imperturbable ease\r\n",
      "and good-humor which is infectious, and like great grassy hills in the\r\n",
      "sunshine, quiets even an irritated egoism, and makes it rather ashamed\r\n",
      "of itself. “Well, how are you?” he said, showing a hand not quite fit\r\n",
      "to be grasped. “Sorry I missed you before. Is there anything\r\n",
      "particular? You look vexed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James’s brow had a little crease in it, a little depression of the\r\n",
      "eyebrow, which he seemed purposely to exaggerate as he answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is only this conduct of Brooke’s. I really think somebody should\r\n",
      "speak to him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What? meaning to stand?” said Mr. Cadwallader, going on with the\r\n",
      "arrangement of the reels which he had just been turning. “I hardly\r\n",
      "think he means it. But where’s the harm, if he likes it? Any one who\r\n",
      "objects to Whiggery should be glad when the Whigs don’t put up the\r\n",
      "strongest fellow. They won’t overturn the Constitution with our friend\r\n",
      "Brooke’s head for a battering ram.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I don’t mean that,” said Sir James, who, after putting down his\r\n",
      "hat and throwing himself into a chair, had begun to nurse his leg and\r\n",
      "examine the sole of his boot with much bitterness. “I mean this\r\n",
      "marriage. I mean his letting that blooming young girl marry Casaubon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is the matter with Casaubon? I see no harm in him—if the girl\r\n",
      "likes him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is too young to know what she likes. Her guardian ought to\r\n",
      "interfere. He ought not to allow the thing to be done in this headlong\r\n",
      "manner. I wonder a man like you, Cadwallader—a man with daughters, can\r\n",
      "look at the affair with indifference: and with such a heart as yours!\r\n",
      "Do think seriously about it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not joking; I am as serious as possible,” said the Rector, with a\r\n",
      "provoking little inward laugh. “You are as bad as Elinor. She has been\r\n",
      "wanting me to go and lecture Brooke; and I have reminded her that her\r\n",
      "friends had a very poor opinion of the match she made when she married\r\n",
      "me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But look at Casaubon,” said Sir James, indignantly. “He must be fifty,\r\n",
      "and I don’t believe he could ever have been much more than the shadow\r\n",
      "of a man. Look at his legs!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Confound you handsome young fellows! you think of having it all your\r\n",
      "own way in the world. You don’t understand women. They don’t admire you\r\n",
      "half so much as you admire yourselves. Elinor used to tell her sisters\r\n",
      "that she married me for my ugliness—it was so various and amusing that\r\n",
      "it had quite conquered her prudence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You! it was easy enough for a woman to love you. But this is no\r\n",
      "question of beauty. I don’t _like_ Casaubon.” This was Sir James’s\r\n",
      "strongest way of implying that he thought ill of a man’s character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why? what do you know against him?” said the Rector laying down his\r\n",
      "reels, and putting his thumbs into his armholes with an air of\r\n",
      "attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James paused. He did not usually find it easy to give his reasons:\r\n",
      "it seemed to him strange that people should not know them without being\r\n",
      "told, since he only felt what was reasonable. At last he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, Cadwallader, has he got any heart?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, yes. I don’t mean of the melting sort, but a sound kernel,\r\n",
      "_that_ you may be sure of. He is very good to his poor relations:\r\n",
      "pensions several of the women, and is educating a young fellow at a\r\n",
      "good deal of expense. Casaubon acts up to his sense of justice. His\r\n",
      "mother’s sister made a bad match—a Pole, I think—lost herself—at any\r\n",
      "rate was disowned by her family. If it had not been for that, Casaubon\r\n",
      "would not have had so much money by half. I believe he went himself to\r\n",
      "find out his cousins, and see what he could do for them. Every man\r\n",
      "would not ring so well as that, if you tried his metal. _You_ would,\r\n",
      "Chettam; but not every man.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know,” said Sir James, coloring. “I am not so sure of myself.”\r\n",
      "He paused a moment, and then added, “That was a right thing for\r\n",
      "Casaubon to do. But a man may wish to do what is right, and yet be a\r\n",
      "sort of parchment code. A woman may not be happy with him. And I think\r\n",
      "when a girl is so young as Miss Brooke is, her friends ought to\r\n",
      "interfere a little to hinder her from doing anything foolish. You\r\n",
      "laugh, because you fancy I have some feeling on my own account. But\r\n",
      "upon my honor, it is not that. I should feel just the same if I were\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke’s brother or uncle.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, but what should you do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should say that the marriage must not be decided on until she was of\r\n",
      "age. And depend upon it, in that case, it would never come off. I wish\r\n",
      "you saw it as I do—I wish you would talk to Brooke about it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James rose as he was finishing his sentence, for he saw Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader entering from the study. She held by the hand her youngest\r\n",
      "girl, about five years old, who immediately ran to papa, and was made\r\n",
      "comfortable on his knee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hear what you are talking about,” said the wife. “But you will make\r\n",
      "no impression on Humphrey. As long as the fish rise to his bait,\r\n",
      "everybody is what he ought to be. Bless you, Casaubon has got a\r\n",
      "trout-stream, and does not care about fishing in it himself: could\r\n",
      "there be a better fellow?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, there is something in that,” said the Rector, with his quiet,\r\n",
      "inward laugh. “It is a very good quality in a man to have a\r\n",
      "trout-stream.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But seriously,” said Sir James, whose vexation had not yet spent\r\n",
      "itself, “don’t you think the Rector might do some good by speaking?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I told you beforehand what he would say,” answered Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader, lifting up her eyebrows. “I have done what I could: I wash\r\n",
      "my hands of the marriage.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the first place,” said the Rector, looking rather grave, “it would\r\n",
      "be nonsensical to expect that I could convince Brooke, and make him act\r\n",
      "accordingly. Brooke is a very good fellow, but pulpy; he will run into\r\n",
      "any mould, but he won’t keep shape.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He might keep shape long enough to defer the marriage,” said Sir\r\n",
      "James.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But, my dear Chettam, why should I use my influence to Casaubon’s\r\n",
      "disadvantage, unless I were much surer than I am that I should be\r\n",
      "acting for the advantage of Miss Brooke? I know no harm of Casaubon. I\r\n",
      "don’t care about his Xisuthrus and Fee-fo-fum and the rest; but then he\r\n",
      "doesn’t care about my fishing-tackle. As to the line he took on the\r\n",
      "Catholic Question, that was unexpected; but he has always been civil to\r\n",
      "me, and I don’t see why I should spoil his sport. For anything I can\r\n",
      "tell, Miss Brooke may be happier with him than she would be with any\r\n",
      "other man.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Humphrey! I have no patience with you. You know you would rather dine\r\n",
      "under the hedge than with Casaubon alone. You have nothing to say to\r\n",
      "each other.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What has that to do with Miss Brooke’s marrying him? She does not do\r\n",
      "it for my amusement.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has got no good red blood in his body,” said Sir James.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No. Somebody put a drop under a magnifying-glass and it was all\r\n",
      "semicolons and parentheses,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why does he not bring out his book, instead of marrying,” said Sir\r\n",
      "James, with a disgust which he held warranted by the sound feeling of\r\n",
      "an English layman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, he dreams footnotes, and they run away with all his brains. They\r\n",
      "say, when he was a little boy, he made an abstract of ‘Hop o’ my\r\n",
      "Thumb,’ and he has been making abstracts ever since. Ugh! And that is\r\n",
      "the man Humphrey goes on saying that a woman may be happy with.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, he is what Miss Brooke likes,” said the Rector. “I don’t profess\r\n",
      "to understand every young lady’s taste.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But if she were your own daughter?” said Sir James.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That would be a different affair. She is _not_ my daughter, and I\r\n",
      "don’t feel called upon to interfere. Casaubon is as good as most of us.\r\n",
      "He is a scholarly clergyman, and creditable to the cloth. Some Radical\r\n",
      "fellow speechifying at Middlemarch said Casaubon was the learned\r\n",
      "straw-chopping incumbent, and Freke was the brick-and-mortar incumbent,\r\n",
      "and I was the angling incumbent. And upon my word, I don’t see that one\r\n",
      "is worse or better than the other.” The Rector ended with his silent\r\n",
      "laugh. He always saw the joke of any satire against himself. His\r\n",
      "conscience was large and easy, like the rest of him: it did only what\r\n",
      "it could do without any trouble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clearly, there would be no interference with Miss Brooke’s marriage\r\n",
      "through Mr. Cadwallader; and Sir James felt with some sadness that she\r\n",
      "was to have perfect liberty of misjudgment. It was a sign of his good\r\n",
      "disposition that he did not slacken at all in his intention of carrying\r\n",
      "out Dorothea’s design of the cottages. Doubtless this persistence was\r\n",
      "the best course for his own dignity: but pride only helps us to be\r\n",
      "generous; it never makes us so, any more than vanity makes us witty.\r\n",
      "She was now enough aware of Sir James’s position with regard to her, to\r\n",
      "appreciate the rectitude of his perseverance in a landlord’s duty, to\r\n",
      "which he had at first been urged by a lover’s complaisance, and her\r\n",
      "pleasure in it was great enough to count for something even in her\r\n",
      "present happiness. Perhaps she gave to Sir James Chettam’s cottages all\r\n",
      "the interest she could spare from Mr. Casaubon, or rather from the\r\n",
      "symphony of hopeful dreams, admiring trust, and passionate self\r\n",
      "devotion which that learned gentleman had set playing in her soul.\r\n",
      "Hence it happened that in the good baronet’s succeeding visits, while\r\n",
      "he was beginning to pay small attentions to Celia, he found himself\r\n",
      "talking with more and more pleasure to Dorothea. She was perfectly\r\n",
      "unconstrained and without irritation towards him now, and he was\r\n",
      "gradually discovering the delight there is in frank kindness and\r\n",
      "companionship between a man and a woman who have no passion to hide or\r\n",

      "Mr. Casaubon’s behavior about settlements was highly satisfactory to\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke, and the preliminaries of marriage rolled smoothly along,\r\n",
      "shortening the weeks of courtship. The betrothed bride must see her\r\n",
      "future home, and dictate any changes that she would like to have made\r\n",
      "there. A woman dictates before marriage in order that she may have an\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "On a gray but dry November morning Dorothea drove to Lowick in company\r\n",
      "with her uncle and Celia. Mr. Casaubon’s home was the manor-house.\r\n",
      "Close by, visible from some parts of the garden, was the little church,\r\n",
      "with the old parsonage opposite. In the beginning of his career, Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon had only held the living, but the death of his brother had put\r\n",
      "him in possession of the manor also. It had a small park, with a fine\r\n",
      "old oak here and there, and an avenue of limes towards the southwest\r\n",
      "front, with a sunk fence between park and pleasure-ground, so that from\r\n",
      "the drawing-room windows the glance swept uninterruptedly along a slope\r\n",
      "of greensward till the limes ended in a level of corn and pastures,\r\n",
      "which often seemed to melt into a lake under the setting sun. This was\r\n",
      "the happy side of the house, for the south and east looked rather\r\n",
      "melancholy even under the brightest morning. The grounds here were more\r\n",
      "confined, the flower-beds showed no very careful tendance, and large\r\n",
      "clumps of trees, chiefly of sombre yews, had risen high, not ten yards\r\n",
      "from the windows. The building, of greenish stone, was in the old\r\n",
      "English style, not ugly, but small-windowed and melancholy-looking: the\r\n",
      "sort of house that must have children, many flowers, open windows, and\r\n",
      "little vistas of bright things, to make it seem a joyous home. In this\r\n",
      "latter end of autumn, with a sparse remnant of yellow leaves falling\r\n",
      "slowly athwart the dark evergreens in a stillness without sunshine, the\r\n",
      "house too had an air of autumnal decline, and Mr. Casaubon, when he\r\n",
      "presented himself, had no bloom that could be thrown into relief by\r\n",
      "that background.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh dear!” Celia said to herself, “I am sure Freshitt Hall would have\r\n",
      "been pleasanter than this.” She thought of the white freestone, the\r\n",
      "pillared portico, and the terrace full of flowers, Sir James smiling\r\n",
      "above them like a prince issuing from his enchantment in a rose-bush,\r\n",
      "with a handkerchief swiftly metamorphosed from the most delicately\r\n",
      "odorous petals—Sir James, who talked so agreeably, always about things\r\n",
      "which had common-sense in them, and not about learning! Celia had those\r\n",
      "light young feminine tastes which grave and weatherworn gentlemen\r\n",
      "sometimes prefer in a wife; but happily Mr. Casaubon’s bias had been\r\n",
      "different, for he would have had no chance with Celia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea, on the contrary, found the house and grounds all that she\r\n",
      "could wish: the dark book-shelves in the long library, the carpets and\r\n",
      "curtains with colors subdued by time, the curious old maps and\r\n",
      "bird’s-eye views on the walls of the corridor, with here and there an\r\n",
      "old vase below, had no oppression for her, and seemed more cheerful\r\n",
      "than the casts and pictures at the Grange, which her uncle had long ago\r\n",
      "brought home from his travels—they being probably among the ideas he\r\n",
      "had taken in at one time. To poor Dorothea these severe classical\r\n",
      "nudities and smirking Renaissance-Correggiosities were painfully\r\n",
      "inexplicable, staring into the midst of her Puritanic conceptions: she\r\n",
      "had never been taught how she could bring them into any sort of\r\n",
      "relevance with her life. But the owners of Lowick apparently had not\r\n",
      "been travellers, and Mr. Casaubon’s studies of the past were not\r\n",
      "carried on by means of such aids.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea walked about the house with delightful emotion. Everything\r\n",
      "seemed hallowed to her: this was to be the home of her wifehood, and\r\n",
      "she looked up with eyes full of confidence to Mr. Casaubon when he drew\r\n",
      "her attention specially to some actual arrangement and asked her if she\r\n",
      "would like an alteration. All appeals to her taste she met gratefully,\r\n",
      "but saw nothing to alter. His efforts at exact courtesy and formal\r\n",
      "tenderness had no defect for her. She filled up all blanks with\r\n",
      "unmanifested perfections, interpreting him as she interpreted the works\r\n",
      "of Providence, and accounting for seeming discords by her own deafness\r\n",
      "to the higher harmonies. And there are many blanks left in the weeks of\r\n",
      "courtship which a loving faith fills with happy assurance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, my dear Dorothea, I wish you to favor me by pointing out which\r\n",
      "room you would like to have as your boudoir,” said Mr. Casaubon,\r\n",
      "showing that his views of the womanly nature were sufficiently large to\r\n",
      "include that requirement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is very kind of you to think of that,” said Dorothea, “but I assure\r\n",
      "you I would rather have all those matters decided for me. I shall be\r\n",
      "much happier to take everything as it is—just as you have been used to\r\n",
      "have it, or as you will yourself choose it to be. I have no motive for\r\n",
      "wishing anything else.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Dodo,” said Celia, “will you not have the bow-windowed room\r\n",
      "up-stairs?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon led the way thither. The bow-window looked down the avenue\r\n",
      "of limes; the furniture was all of a faded blue, and there were\r\n",
      "miniatures of ladies and gentlemen with powdered hair hanging in a\r\n",
      "group. A piece of tapestry over a door also showed a blue-green world\r\n",
      "with a pale stag in it. The chairs and tables were thin-legged and easy\r\n",
      "to upset. It was a room where one might fancy the ghost of a\r\n",
      "tight-laced lady revisiting the scene of her embroidery. A light\r\n",
      "bookcase contained duodecimo volumes of polite literature in calf,\r\n",
      "completing the furniture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, “this would be a pretty room with some new\r\n",
      "hangings, sofas, and that sort of thing. A little bare now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, uncle,” said Dorothea, eagerly. “Pray do not speak of altering\r\n",
      "anything. There are so many other things in the world that want\r\n",
      "altering—I like to take these things as they are. And you like them as\r\n",
      "they are, don’t you?” she added, looking at Mr. Casaubon. “Perhaps this\r\n",
      "was your mother’s room when she was young.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was,” he said, with his slow bend of the head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is your mother,” said Dorothea, who had turned to examine the\r\n",
      "group of miniatures. “It is like the tiny one you brought me; only, I\r\n",
      "should think, a better portrait. And this one opposite, who is this?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Her elder sister. They were, like you and your sister, the only two\r\n",
      "children of their parents, who hang above them, you see.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The sister is pretty,” said Celia, implying that she thought less\r\n",
      "favorably of Mr. Casaubon’s mother. It was a new opening to Celia’s\r\n",
      "imagination, that he came of a family who had all been young in their\r\n",
      "time—the ladies wearing necklaces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a peculiar face,” said Dorothea, looking closely. “Those deep\r\n",
      "gray eyes rather near together—and the delicate irregular nose with a\r\n",
      "sort of ripple in it—and all the powdered curls hanging backward.\r\n",
      "Altogether it seems to me peculiar rather than pretty. There is not\r\n",
      "even a family likeness between her and your mother.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No. And they were not alike in their lot.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You did not mention her to me,” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My aunt made an unfortunate marriage. I never saw her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea wondered a little, but felt that it would be indelicate just\r\n",
      "then to ask for any information which Mr. Casaubon did not proffer, and\r\n",
      "she turned to the window to admire the view. The sun had lately pierced\r\n",
      "the gray, and the avenue of limes cast shadows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall we not walk in the garden now?” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you would like to see the church, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “It\r\n",
      "is a droll little church. And the village. It all lies in a nut-shell.\r\n",
      "By the way, it will suit you, Dorothea; for the cottages are like a row\r\n",
      "of alms-houses—little gardens, gilly-flowers, that sort of thing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, please,” said Dorothea, looking at Mr. Casaubon, “I should like\r\n",
      "to see all that.” She had got nothing from him more graphic about the\r\n",
      "Lowick cottages than that they were “not bad.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were soon on a gravel walk which led chiefly between grassy\r\n",
      "borders and clumps of trees, this being the nearest way to the church,\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon said. At the little gate leading into the churchyard there\r\n",
      "was a pause while Mr. Casaubon went to the parsonage close by to fetch\r\n",
      "a key. Celia, who had been hanging a little in the rear, came up\r\n",
      "presently, when she saw that Mr. Casaubon was gone away, and said in\r\n",
      "her easy staccato, which always seemed to contradict the suspicion of\r\n",
      "any malicious intent—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know, Dorothea, I saw some one quite young coming up one of the\r\n",
      "walks.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is that astonishing, Celia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There may be a young gardener, you know—why not?” said Mr. Brooke. “I\r\n",
      "told Casaubon he should change his gardener.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, not a gardener,” said Celia; “a gentleman with a sketch-book. He\r\n",
      "had light-brown curls. I only saw his back. But he was quite young.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The curate’s son, perhaps,” said Mr. Brooke. “Ah, there is Casaubon\r\n",
      "again, and Tucker with him. He is going to introduce Tucker. You don’t\r\n",
      "know Tucker yet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Tucker was the middle-aged curate, one of the “inferior clergy,”\r\n",
      "who are usually not wanting in sons. But after the introduction, the\r\n",
      "conversation did not lead to any question about his family, and the\r\n",
      "startling apparition of youthfulness was forgotten by every one but\r\n",
      "Celia. She inwardly declined to believe that the light-brown curls and\r\n",
      "slim figure could have any relationship to Mr. Tucker, who was just as\r\n",
      "old and musty-looking as she would have expected Mr. Casaubon’s curate\r\n",
      "to be; doubtless an excellent man who would go to heaven (for Celia\r\n",
      "wished not to be unprincipled), but the corners of his mouth were so\r\n",
      "unpleasant. Celia thought with some dismalness of the time she should\r\n",
      "have to spend as bridesmaid at Lowick, while the curate had probably no\r\n",
      "pretty little children whom she could like, irrespective of principle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Tucker was invaluable in their walk; and perhaps Mr. Casaubon had\r\n",
      "not been without foresight on this head, the curate being able to\r\n",
      "answer all Dorothea’s questions about the villagers and the other\r\n",
      "parishioners. Everybody, he assured her, was well off in Lowick: not a\r\n",
      "cottager in those double cottages at a low rent but kept a pig, and the\r\n",
      "strips of garden at the back were well tended. The small boys wore\r\n",
      "excellent corduroy, the girls went out as tidy servants, or did a\r\n",
      "little straw-plaiting at home: no looms here, no Dissent; and though\r\n",
      "the public disposition was rather towards laying by money than towards\r\n",
      "spirituality, there was not much vice. The speckled fowls were so\r\n",
      "numerous that Mr. Brooke observed, “Your farmers leave some barley for\r\n",
      "the women to glean, I see. The poor folks here might have a fowl in\r\n",
      "their pot, as the good French king used to wish for all his people. The\r\n",
      "French eat a good many fowls—skinny fowls, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think it was a very cheap wish of his,” said Dorothea, indignantly.\r\n",
      "“Are kings such monsters that a wish like that must be reckoned a royal\r\n",
      "virtue?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And if he wished them a skinny fowl,” said Celia, “that would not be\r\n",
      "nice. But perhaps he wished them to have fat fowls.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, but the word has dropped out of the text, or perhaps was\r\n",
      "subauditum; that is, present in the king’s mind, but not uttered,” said\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon, smiling and bending his head towards Celia, who\r\n",
      "immediately dropped backward a little, because she could not bear Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon to blink at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea sank into silence on the way back to the house. She felt some\r\n",
      "disappointment, of which she was yet ashamed, that there was nothing\r\n",
      "for her to do in Lowick; and in the next few minutes her mind had\r\n",
      "glanced over the possibility, which she would have preferred, of\r\n",
      "finding that her home would be in a parish which had a larger share of\r\n",
      "the world’s misery, so that she might have had more active duties in\r\n",
      "it. Then, recurring to the future actually before her, she made a\r\n",
      "picture of more complete devotion to Mr. Casaubon’s aims in which she\r\n",
      "would await new duties. Many such might reveal themselves to the higher\r\n",
      "knowledge gained by her in that companionship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Tucker soon left them, having some clerical work which would not\r\n",
      "allow him to lunch at the Hall; and as they were re-entering the garden\r\n",
      "through the little gate, Mr. Casaubon said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem a little sad, Dorothea. I trust you are pleased with what you\r\n",
      "have seen.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am feeling something which is perhaps foolish and wrong,” answered\r\n",
      "Dorothea, with her usual openness—“almost wishing that the people\r\n",
      "wanted more to be done for them here. I have known so few ways of\r\n",
      "making my life good for anything. Of course, my notions of usefulness\r\n",
      "must be narrow. I must learn new ways of helping people.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Doubtless,” said Mr. Casaubon. “Each position has its corresponding\r\n",
      "duties. Yours, I trust, as the mistress of Lowick, will not leave any\r\n",
      "yearning unfulfilled.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed, I believe that,” said Dorothea, earnestly. “Do not suppose\r\n",
      "that I am sad.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is well. But, if you are not tired, we will take another way to\r\n",
      "the house than that by which we came.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was not at all tired, and a little circuit was made towards a\r\n",
      "fine yew-tree, the chief hereditary glory of the grounds on this side\r\n",
      "of the house. As they approached it, a figure, conspicuous on a dark\r\n",
      "background of evergreens, was seated on a bench, sketching the old\r\n",
      "tree. Mr. Brooke, who was walking in front with Celia, turned his head,\r\n",
      "and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who is that youngster, Casaubon?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had come very near when Mr. Casaubon answered—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is a young relative of mine, a second cousin: the grandson, in\r\n",
      "fact,” he added, looking at Dorothea, “of the lady whose portrait you\r\n",
      "have been noticing, my aunt Julia.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man had laid down his sketch-book and risen. His bushy\r\n",
      "light-brown curls, as well as his youthfulness, identified him at once\r\n",
      "with Celia’s apparition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea, let me introduce to you my cousin, Mr. Ladislaw. Will, this\r\n",
      "is Miss Brooke.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cousin was so close now, that, when he lifted his hat, Dorothea\r\n",
      "could see a pair of gray eyes rather near together, a delicate\r\n",
      "irregular nose with a little ripple in it, and hair falling backward;\r\n",
      "but there was a mouth and chin of a more prominent, threatening aspect\r\n",
      "than belonged to the type of the grandmother’s miniature. Young\r\n",
      "Ladislaw did not feel it necessary to smile, as if he were charmed with\r\n",
      "this introduction to his future second cousin and her relatives; but\r\n",
      "wore rather a pouting air of discontent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are an artist, I see,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the sketch-book\r\n",
      "and turning it over in his unceremonious fashion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I only sketch a little. There is nothing fit to be seen there,”\r\n",
      "said young Ladislaw, coloring, perhaps with temper rather than modesty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, come, this is a nice bit, now. I did a little in this way myself\r\n",
      "at one time, you know. Look here, now; this is what I call a nice\r\n",
      "thing, done with what we used to call _brio_.” Mr. Brooke held out\r\n",
      "towards the two girls a large colored sketch of stony ground and trees,\r\n",
      "with a pool.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am no judge of these things,” said Dorothea, not coldly, but with an\r\n",
      "eager deprecation of the appeal to her. “You know, uncle, I never see\r\n",
      "the beauty of those pictures which you say are so much praised. They\r\n",
      "are a language I do not understand. I suppose there is some relation\r\n",
      "between pictures and nature which I am too ignorant to feel—just as you\r\n",
      "see what a Greek sentence stands for which means nothing to me.”\r\n",
      "Dorothea looked up at Mr. Casaubon, who bowed his head towards her,\r\n",
      "while Mr. Brooke said, smiling nonchalantly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bless me, now, how different people are! But you had a bad style of\r\n",
      "teaching, you know—else this is just the thing for girls—sketching,\r\n",
      "fine art and so on. But you took to drawing plans; you don’t understand\r\n",
      "_morbidezza_, and that kind of thing. You will come to my house, I\r\n",
      "hope, and I will show you what I did in this way,” he continued,\r\n",
      "turning to young Ladislaw, who had to be recalled from his\r\n",
      "preoccupation in observing Dorothea. Ladislaw had made up his mind that\r\n",
      "she must be an unpleasant girl, since she was going to marry Casaubon,\r\n",
      "and what she said of her stupidity about pictures would have confirmed\r\n",
      "that opinion even if he had believed her. As it was, he took her words\r\n",
      "for a covert judgment, and was certain that she thought his sketch\r\n",
      "detestable. There was too much cleverness in her apology: she was\r\n",
      "laughing both at her uncle and himself. But what a voice! It was like\r\n",
      "the voice of a soul that had once lived in an Aeolian harp. This must\r\n",
      "be one of Nature’s inconsistencies. There could be no sort of passion\r\n",
      "in a girl who would marry Casaubon. But he turned from her, and bowed\r\n",
      "his thanks for Mr. Brooke’s invitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We will turn over my Italian engravings together,” continued that\r\n",
      "good-natured man. “I have no end of those things, that I have laid by\r\n",
      "for years. One gets rusty in this part of the country, you know. Not\r\n",
      "you, Casaubon; you stick to your studies; but my best ideas get\r\n",
      "undermost—out of use, you know. You clever young men must guard against\r\n",
      "indolence. I was too indolent, you know: else I might have been\r\n",
      "anywhere at one time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is a seasonable admonition,” said Mr. Casaubon; “but now we will\r\n",
      "pass on to the house, lest the young ladies should be tired of\r\n",
      "standing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When their backs were turned, young Ladislaw sat down to go on with his\r\n",
      "sketching, and as he did so his face broke into an expression of\r\n",
      "amusement which increased as he went on drawing, till at last he threw\r\n",
      "back his head and laughed aloud. Partly it was the reception of his own\r\n",
      "artistic production that tickled him; partly the notion of his grave\r\n",
      "cousin as the lover of that girl; and partly Mr. Brooke’s definition of\r\n",
      "the place he might have held but for the impediment of indolence. Mr.\r\n",
      "Will Ladislaw’s sense of the ludicrous lit up his features very\r\n",
      "agreeably: it was the pure enjoyment of comicality, and had no mixture\r\n",
      "of sneering and self-exaltation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is your nephew going to do with himself, Casaubon?” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke, as they went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My cousin, you mean—not my nephew.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, cousin. But in the way of a career, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The answer to that question is painfully doubtful. On leaving Rugby he\r\n",
      "declined to go to an English university, where I would gladly have\r\n",
      "placed him, and chose what I must consider the anomalous course of\r\n",
      "studying at Heidelberg. And now he wants to go abroad again, without\r\n",
      "any special object, save the vague purpose of what he calls culture,\r\n",
      "preparation for he knows not what. He declines to choose a profession.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has no means but what you furnish, I suppose.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have always given him and his friends reason to understand that I\r\n",
      "would furnish in moderation what was necessary for providing him with a\r\n",
      "scholarly education, and launching him respectably. I am therefore\r\n",
      "bound to fulfil the expectation so raised,” said Mr. Casaubon, putting\r\n",
      "his conduct in the light of mere rectitude: a trait of delicacy which\r\n",
      "Dorothea noticed with admiration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has a thirst for travelling; perhaps he may turn out a Bruce or a\r\n",
      "Mungo Park,” said Mr. Brooke. “I had a notion of that myself at one\r\n",
      "time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, he has no bent towards exploration, or the enlargement of our\r\n",
      "geognosis: that would be a special purpose which I could recognize with\r\n",
      "some approbation, though without felicitating him on a career which so\r\n",
      "often ends in premature and violent death. But so far is he from having\r\n",
      "any desire for a more accurate knowledge of the earth’s surface, that\r\n",
      "he said he should prefer not to know the sources of the Nile, and that\r\n",
      "there should be some unknown regions preserved as hunting grounds for\r\n",
      "the poetic imagination.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, there is something in that, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, who had\r\n",
      "certainly an impartial mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is, I fear, nothing more than a part of his general inaccuracy and\r\n",
      "indisposition to thoroughness of all kinds, which would be a bad augury\r\n",
      "for him in any profession, civil or sacred, even were he so far\r\n",
      "submissive to ordinary rule as to choose one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps he has conscientious scruples founded on his own unfitness,”\r\n",
      "said Dorothea, who was interesting herself in finding a favorable\r\n",
      "explanation. “Because the law and medicine should be very serious\r\n",
      "professions to undertake, should they not? People’s lives and fortunes\r\n",
      "depend on them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Doubtless; but I fear that my young relative Will Ladislaw is chiefly\r\n",
      "determined in his aversion to these callings by a dislike to steady\r\n",
      "application, and to that kind of acquirement which is needful\r\n",
      "instrumentally, but is not charming or immediately inviting to\r\n",
      "self-indulgent taste. I have insisted to him on what Aristotle has\r\n",
      "stated with admirable brevity, that for the achievement of any work\r\n",
      "regarded as an end there must be a prior exercise of many energies or\r\n",
      "acquired facilities of a secondary order, demanding patience. I have\r\n",
      "pointed to my own manuscript volumes, which represent the toil of years\r\n",
      "preparatory to a work not yet accomplished. But in vain. To careful\r\n",
      "reasoning of this kind he replies by calling himself Pegasus, and every\r\n",
      "form of prescribed work ‘harness.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia laughed. She was surprised to find that Mr. Casaubon could say\r\n",
      "something quite amusing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you know, he may turn out a Byron, a Chatterton, a\r\n",
      "Churchill—that sort of thing—there’s no telling,” said Mr. Brooke.\r\n",
      "“Shall you let him go to Italy, or wherever else he wants to go?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; I have agreed to furnish him with moderate supplies for a year or\r\n",
      "so; he asks no more. I shall let him be tried by the test of freedom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is very kind of you,” said Dorothea, looking up at Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "with delight. “It is noble. After all, people may really have in them\r\n",
      "some vocation which is not quite plain to themselves, may they not?\r\n",
      "They may seem idle and weak because they are growing. We should be very\r\n",
      "patient with each other, I think.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose it is being engaged to be married that has made you think\r\n",
      "patience good,” said Celia, as soon as she and Dorothea were alone\r\n",
      "together, taking off their wrappings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You mean that I am very impatient, Celia.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; when people don’t do and say just what you like.” Celia had\r\n",
      "become less afraid of “saying things” to Dorothea since this\r\n",

      "Young Ladislaw did not pay that visit to which Mr. Brooke had invited\r\n",
      "him, and only six days afterwards Mr. Casaubon mentioned that his young\r\n",
      "relative had started for the Continent, seeming by this cold vagueness\r\n",
      "to waive inquiry. Indeed, Will had declined to fix on any more precise\r\n",
      "destination than the entire area of Europe. Genius, he held, is\r\n",
      "necessarily intolerant of fetters: on the one hand it must have the\r\n",
      "utmost play for its spontaneity; on the other, it may confidently await\r\n",
      "those messages from the universe which summon it to its peculiar work,\r\n",
      "only placing itself in an attitude of receptivity towards all sublime\r\n",
      "chances. The attitudes of receptivity are various, and Will had\r\n",
      "sincerely tried many of them. He was not excessively fond of wine, but\r\n",
      "he had several times taken too much, simply as an experiment in that\r\n",
      "form of ecstasy; he had fasted till he was faint, and then supped on\r\n",
      "lobster; he had made himself ill with doses of opium. Nothing greatly\r\n",
      "original had resulted from these measures; and the effects of the opium\r\n",
      "had convinced him that there was an entire dissimilarity between his\r\n",
      "constitution and De Quincey’s. The superadded circumstance which would\r\n",
      "evolve the genius had not yet come; the universe had not yet beckoned.\r\n",
      "Even Caesar’s fortune at one time was but a grand presentiment. We know\r\n",

      "disguised in helpless embryos. In fact, the world is full of hopeful\r\n",

      "“You must have misunderstood me very much,” she said, “if you think I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That is very amiable in you, my dear Dorothea,” said Mr. Casaubon, not\r\n",
      "in the least noticing that she was hurt; “but if you had a lady as your\r\n",

      "of the parties which were held at the Grange as proper preliminaries to\r\n",
      "the wedding, and Dorothea was glad of a reason for moving away at once\r\n",
      "on the sound of the bell, as if she needed more than her usual amount\r\n",
      "of preparation. She was ashamed of being irritated from some cause she\r\n",
      "could not define even to herself; for though she had no intention to be\r\n",
      "untruthful, her reply had not touched the real hurt within her. Mr.\r\n",

      "vague instantaneous sense of aloofness on his part.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Surely I am in a strangely selfish weak state of mind,” she said to\r\n",

      "Having convinced herself that Mr. Casaubon was altogether right, she\r\n",

      "lines of her dark-brown hair parted over her brow and coiled massively\r\n",
      "behind, in keeping with the entire absence from her manner and\r\n",
      "expression of all search after mere effect. Sometimes when Dorothea was\r\n",
      "in company, there seemed to be as complete an air of repose about her\r\n",
      "as if she had been a picture of Santa Barbara looking out from her\r\n",
      "tower into the clear air; but these intervals of quietude made the\r\n",
      "energy of her speech and emotion the more remarked when some outward\r\n",
      "appeal had touched her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was naturally the subject of many observations this evening, for\r\n",
      "the dinner-party was large and rather more miscellaneous as to the male\r\n",
      "portion than any which had been held at the Grange since Mr. Brooke’s\r\n",
      "nieces had resided with him, so that the talking was done in duos and\r\n",
      "trios more or less inharmonious. There was the newly elected mayor of\r\n",
      "Middlemarch, who happened to be a manufacturer; the philanthropic\r\n",
      "banker his brother-in-law, who predominated so much in the town that\r\n",
      "some called him a Methodist, others a hypocrite, according to the\r\n",
      "resources of their vocabulary; and there were various professional men.\r\n",
      "In fact, Mrs. Cadwallader said that Brooke was beginning to treat the\r\n",
      "Middlemarchers, and that she preferred the farmers at the tithe-dinner,\r\n",
      "who drank her health unpretentiously, and were not ashamed of their\r\n",
      "grandfathers’ furniture. For in that part of the country, before reform\r\n",
      "had done its notable part in developing the political consciousness,\r\n",
      "there was a clearer distinction of ranks and a dimmer distinction of\r\n",
      "parties; so that Mr. Brooke’s miscellaneous invitations seemed to\r\n",
      "belong to that general laxity which came from his inordinate travel and\r\n",
      "habit of taking too much in the form of ideas.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Already, as Miss Brooke passed out of the dining-room, opportunity was\r\n",
      "found for some interjectional “asides.”\r\n",

      "“A fine woman, Miss Brooke! an uncommonly fine woman, by God!” said Mr.\r\n",

      "landed gentry that he had become landed himself, and used that oath in\r\n",
      "a deep-mouthed manner as a sort of armorial bearings, stamping the\r\n",
      "speech of a man who held a good position.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode, the banker, seemed to be addressed, but that gentleman\r\n",
      "disliked coarseness and profanity, and merely bowed. The remark was\r\n",
      "taken up by Mr. Chichely, a middle-aged bachelor and coursing\r\n",
      "celebrity, who had a complexion something like an Easter egg, a few\r\n",
      "hairs carefully arranged, and a carriage implying the consciousness of\r\n",
      "a distinguished appearance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, but not my style of woman: I like a woman who lays herself out a\r\n",
      "little more to please us. There should be a little filigree about a\r\n",
      "woman—something of the coquette. A man likes a sort of challenge. The\r\n",
      "more of a dead set she makes at you the better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s some truth in that,” said Mr. Standish, disposed to be genial.\r\n",
      "“And, by God, it’s usually the way with them. I suppose it answers some\r\n",
      "wise ends: Providence made them so, eh, Bulstrode?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should be disposed to refer coquetry to another source,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode. “I should rather refer it to the devil.”\r\n",

      "to his theology. “And I like them blond, with a certain gait, and a\r\n",
      "swan neck. Between ourselves, the mayor’s daughter is more to my taste\r\n",
      "than Miss Brooke or Miss Celia either. If I were a marrying man I\r\n",
      "should choose Miss Vincy before either of them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, make up, make up,” said Mr. Standish, jocosely; “you see the\r\n",
      "middle-aged fellows carry the day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Chichely shook his head with much meaning: he was not going to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The Miss Vincy who had the honor of being Mr. Chichely’s ideal was of\r\n",
      "course not present; for Mr. Brooke, always objecting to go too far,\r\n",
      "would not have chosen that his nieces should meet the daughter of a\r\n",
      "Middlemarch manufacturer, unless it were on a public occasion. The\r\n",
      "feminine part of the company included none whom Lady Chettam or Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader could object to; for Mrs. Renfrew, the colonel’s widow, was\r\n",
      "not only unexceptionable in point of breeding, but also interesting on\r\n",
      "the ground of her complaint, which puzzled the doctors, and seemed\r\n",
      "clearly a case wherein the fulness of professional knowledge might need\r\n",
      "the supplement of quackery. Lady Chettam, who attributed her own\r\n",
      "remarkable health to home-made bitters united with constant medical\r\n",
      "attendance, entered with much exercise of the imagination into Mrs.\r\n",
      "Renfrew’s account of symptoms, and into the amazing futility in her\r\n",
      "case of all strengthening medicines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?” said the\r\n",
      "mild but stately dowager, turning to Mrs. Cadwallader reflectively,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“It strengthens the disease,” said the Rector’s wife, much too\r\n",
      "well-born not to be an amateur in medicine. “Everything depends on the\r\n",
      "constitution: some people make fat, some blood, and some bile—that’s my\r\n",
      "view of the matter; and whatever they take is a sort of grist to the\r\n",
      "mill.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“James,” said Lady Chettam when her son came near, “bring Mr. Lydgate\r\n",

      "impressiveness as a listener. He was as little as possible like the\r\n",
      "lamented Hicks, especially in a certain careless refinement about his\r\n",
      "toilet and utterance. Yet Lady Chettam gathered much confidence in him.\r\n",
      "He confirmed her view of her own constitution as being peculiar, by\r\n",
      "admitting that all constitutions might be called peculiar, and he did\r\n",
      "not deny that hers might be more peculiar than others. He did not\r\n",
      "approve of a too lowering system, including reckless cupping, nor, on\r\n",
      "the other hand, of incessant port wine and bark. He said “I think so”\r\n",
      "with an air of so much deference accompanying the insight of agreement,\r\n",
      "that she formed the most cordial opinion of his talents.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "going away.\r\n",

      "“My protege?—dear me!—who is that?” said Mr. Brooke.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Lydgate! he is not my protege, you know; only I knew an uncle of\r\n",
      "his who sent me a letter about him. However, I think he is likely to be\r\n",
      "first-rate—has studied in Paris, knew Broussais; has ideas, you\r\n",
      "know—wants to raise the profession.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lydgate has lots of ideas, quite new, about ventilation and diet, that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Medical knowledge is at a low ebb among us,” said Mr. Bulstrode, who\r\n",
      "spoke in a subdued tone, and had rather a sickly air. “I, for my part,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "Bulstrode; “if you like him to try experiments on your hospital\r\n",
      "patients, and kill a few people for charity I have no objection. But I\r\n",
      "am not going to hand money out of my purse to have experiments tried on\r\n",
      "me. I like treatment that has been tested a little.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you know, Standish, every dose you take is an experiment-an\r\n",
      "experiment, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, nodding towards the lawyer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, if you talk in that sense!” said Mr. Standish, with as much\r\n",
      "disgust at such non-legal quibbling as a man can well betray towards a\r\n",
      "valuable client.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "florid man, who would have served for a study of flesh in striking\r\n",
      "contrast with the Franciscan tints of Mr. Bulstrode. “It’s an\r\n",
      "uncommonly dangerous thing to be left without any padding against the\r\n",

      "expression myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Lydgate, of course, was out of hearing. He had quitted the party\r\n",
      "early, and would have thought it altogether tedious but for the novelty\r\n",
      "of certain introductions, especially the introduction to Miss Brooke,\r\n",
      "whose youthful bloom, with her approaching marriage to that faded\r\n",
      "scholar, and her interest in matters socially useful, gave her the\r\n",
      "piquancy of an unusual combination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is a good creature—that fine girl—but a little too earnest,” he\r\n",

      "wanting reasons, yet they are too ignorant to understand the merits of\r\n",
      "any question, and usually fall back on their moral sense to settle\r\n",
      "things after their own taste.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "than Mr. Chichely’s. Considered, indeed, in relation to the latter,\r\n",
      "whose mind was matured, she was altogether a mistake, and calculated to\r\n",
      "shock his trust in final causes, including the adaptation of fine young\r\n",
      "women to purplefaced bachelors. But Lydgate was less ripe, and might\r\n",
      "possibly have experience before him which would modify his opinion as\r\n",
      "to the most excellent things in woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke, however, was not again seen by either of these gentlemen\r\n",

      "strikingly different from Miss Brooke: he did not in the least suppose\r\n",
      "that he had lost his balance and fallen in love, but he had said of\r\n",
      "that particular woman, “She is grace itself; she is perfectly lovely\r\n",

      "chosen if he had intended to marry speedily, his remaining a bachelor\r\n",
      "will usually depend on her resolution rather than on his. Lydgate\r\n",
      "believed that he should not marry for several years: not marry until he\r\n",
      "had trodden out a good clear path for himself away from the broad road\r\n",
      "which was quite ready made. He had seen Miss Vincy above his horizon\r\n",
      "almost as long as it had taken Mr. Casaubon to become engaged and\r\n",
      "married: but this learned gentleman was possessed of a fortune; he had\r\n",
      "assembled his voluminous notes, and had made that sort of reputation\r\n",
      "which precedes performance,—often the larger part of a man’s fame. He\r\n",
      "took a wife, as we have seen, to adorn the remaining quadrant of his\r\n",
      "course, and be a little moon that would cause hardly a calculable\r\n",
      "perturbation. But Lydgate was young, poor, ambitious. He had his\r\n",
      "half-century before him instead of behind him, and he had come to\r\n",
      "Middlemarch bent on doing many things that were not directly fitted to\r\n",
      "make his fortune or even secure him a good income. To a man under such\r\n",
      "circumstances, taking a wife is something more than a question of\r\n",
      "adornment, however highly he may rate this; and Lydgate was disposed to\r\n",
      "give it the first place among wifely functions. To his taste, guided by\r\n",
      "a single conversation, here was the point on which Miss Brooke would be\r\n",
      "found wanting, notwithstanding her undeniable beauty. She did not look\r\n",
      "at things from the proper feminine angle. The society of such women was\r\n",
      "about as relaxing as going from your work to teach the second form,\r\n",
      "instead of reclining in a paradise with sweet laughs for bird-notes,\r\n",
      "and blue eyes for a heaven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certainly nothing at present could seem much less important to Lydgate\r\n",
      "than the turn of Miss Brooke’s mind, or to Miss Brooke than the\r\n",
      "qualities of the woman who had attracted this young surgeon. But any\r\n",
      "one watching keenly the stealthy convergence of human lots, sees a slow\r\n",
      "preparation of effects from one life on another, which tells like a\r\n",
      "calculated irony on the indifference or the frozen stare with which we\r\n",

      "Old provincial society had its share of this subtle movement: had not\r\n",
      "only its striking downfalls, its brilliant young professional dandies\r\n",
      "who ended by living up an entry with a drab and six children for their\r\n",
      "establishment, but also those less marked vicissitudes which are\r\n",
      "constantly shifting the boundaries of social intercourse, and begetting\r\n",

      "surprisingly grouped in consequence; while a few personages or families\r\n",
      "that stood with rocky firmness amid all this fluctuation, were slowly\r\n",
      "presenting new aspects in spite of solidity, and altering with the\r\n",
      "double change of self and beholder. Municipal town and rural parish\r\n",
      "gradually made fresh threads of connection—gradually, as the old\r\n",
      "stocking gave way to the savings-bank, and the worship of the solar\r\n",

      "for his starting-point; though Io, as a maiden apparently beguiled by\r\n",
      "attractive merchandise, was the reverse of Miss Brooke, and in this\r\n",
      "respect perhaps bore more resemblance to Rosamond Vincy, who had\r\n",
      "excellent taste in costume, with that nymph-like figure and pure\r\n",
      "blondness which give the largest range to choice in the flow and color\r\n",
      "of drapery. But these things made only part of her charm. She was\r\n",

      "the county, where the teaching included all that was demanded in the\r\n",
      "accomplished female—even to extras, such as the getting in and out of a\r\n",
      "carriage. Mrs. Lemon herself had always held up Miss Vincy as an\r\n",
      "example: no pupil, she said, exceeded that young lady for mental\r\n",
      "acquisition and propriety of speech, while her musical execution was\r\n",
      "quite exceptional. We cannot help the way in which people speak of us,\r\n",
      "and probably if Mrs. Lemon had undertaken to describe Juliet or Imogen,\r\n",
      "these heroines would not have seemed poetical. The first vision of\r\n",
      "Rosamond would have been enough with most judges to dispel any\r\n",
      "prejudice excited by Mrs. Lemon’s praise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate could not be long in Middlemarch without having that agreeable\r\n",
      "vision, or even without making the acquaintance of the Vincy family;\r\n",
      "for though Mr. Peacock, whose practice he had paid something to enter\r\n",
      "on, had not been their doctor (Mrs. Vincy not liking the lowering\r\n",
      "system adopted by him), he had many patients among their connections\r\n",
      "and acquaintances. For who of any consequence in Middlemarch was not\r\n",
      "connected or at least acquainted with the Vincys? They were old\r\n",
      "manufacturers, and had kept a good house for three generations, in\r\n",
      "which there had naturally been much intermarrying with neighbors more\r\n",
      "or less decidedly genteel. Mr. Vincy’s sister had made a wealthy match\r\n",
      "in accepting Mr. Bulstrode, who, however, as a man not born in the\r\n",
      "town, and altogether of dimly known origin, was considered to have done\r\n",
      "well in uniting himself with a real Middlemarch family; on the other\r\n",
      "hand, Mr. Vincy had descended a little, having taken an innkeeper’s\r\n",
      "daughter. But on this side too there was a cheering sense of money; for\r\n",
      "Mrs. Vincy’s sister had been second wife to rich old Mr. Featherstone,\r\n",
      "and had died childless years ago, so that her nephews and nieces might\r\n",
      "be supposed to touch the affections of the widower. And it happened\r\n",
      "that Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Featherstone, two of Peacock’s most\r\n",
      "important patients, had, from different causes, given an especially\r\n",
      "good reception to his successor, who had raised some partisanship as\r\n",
      "well as discussion. Mr. Wrench, medical attendant to the Vincy family,\r\n",
      "very early had grounds for thinking lightly of Lydgate’s professional\r\n",
      "discretion, and there was no report about him which was not retailed at\r\n",
      "the Vincys’, where visitors were frequent. Mr. Vincy was more inclined\r\n",
      "to general good-fellowship than to taking sides, but there was no need\r\n",
      "for him to be hasty in making any new man acquaintance. Rosamond\r\n",
      "silently wished that her father would invite Mr. Lydgate. She was tired\r\n",
      "of the faces and figures she had always been used to—the various\r\n",
      "irregular profiles and gaits and turns of phrase distinguishing those\r\n",
      "Middlemarch young men whom she had known as boys. She had been at\r\n",
      "school with girls of higher position, whose brothers, she felt sure, it\r\n",
      "would have been possible for her to be more interested in, than in\r\n",
      "these inevitable Middlemarch companions. But she would not have chosen\r\n",
      "to mention her wish to her father; and he, for his part, was in no\r\n",
      "hurry on the subject. An alderman about to be mayor must by-and-by\r\n",
      "enlarge his dinner-parties, but at present there were plenty of guests\r\n",
      "at his well-spread table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That table often remained covered with the relics of the family\r\n",
      "breakfast long after Mr. Vincy had gone with his second son to the\r\n",
      "warehouse, and when Miss Morgan was already far on in morning lessons\r\n",
      "with the younger girls in the schoolroom. It awaited the family\r\n",
      "laggard, who found any sort of inconvenience (to others) less\r\n",
      "disagreeable than getting up when he was called. This was the case one\r\n",
      "morning of the October in which we have lately seen Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "visiting the Grange; and though the room was a little overheated with\r\n",
      "the fire, which had sent the spaniel panting to a remote corner,\r\n",
      "Rosamond, for some reason, continued to sit at her embroidery longer\r\n",
      "than usual, now and then giving herself a little shake, and laying her\r\n",
      "work on her knee to contemplate it with an air of hesitating weariness.\r\n",
      "Her mamma, who had returned from an excursion to the kitchen, sat on\r\n",
      "the other side of the small work-table with an air of more entire\r\n",
      "placidity, until, the clock again giving notice that it was going to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Fred felt himself to be in a disgusting dilemma.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must be joking, sir. Mr. Bulstrode, like other men, believes\r\n",
      "scores of things that are not true, and he has a prejudice against me.\r\n",
      "I could easily get him to write that he knew no facts in proof of the\r\n",
      "report you speak of, though it might lead to unpleasantness. But I\r\n",
      "could hardly ask him to write down what he believes or does not believe\r\n",
      "about me.” Fred paused an instant, and then added, in politic appeal to\r\n",
      "his uncle’s vanity, “That is hardly a thing for a gentleman to ask.”\r\n",
      "But he was disappointed in the result.\r\n",

      "speckilating fellow! He may come down any day, when the devil leaves\r\n",
      "off backing him. And that’s what his religion means: he wants God\r\n",
      "A’mighty to come in. That’s nonsense! There’s one thing I made out\r\n",
      "pretty clear when I used to go to church—and it’s this: God A’mighty\r\n",
      "sticks to the land. He promises land, and He gives land, and He makes\r\n",
      "chaps rich with corn and cattle. But you take the other side. You like\r\n",
      "Bulstrode and speckilation better than Featherstone and land.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Fred, rising, standing with his back to\r\n",
      "the fire and beating his boot with his whip. “I like neither Bulstrode\r\n",
      "nor speculation.” He spoke rather sulkily, feeling himself stalemated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, well, you can do without me, that’s pretty clear,” said old\r\n",
      "Featherstone, secretly disliking the possibility that Fred would show\r\n",
      "himself at all independent. “You neither want a bit of land to make a\r\n",
      "squire of you instead of a starving parson, nor a lift of a hundred\r\n",
      "pound by the way. It’s all one to me. I can make five codicils if I\r\n",

      "me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred colored again. Featherstone had rarely given him presents of\r\n",
      "money, and at this moment it seemed almost harder to part with the\r\n",
      "immediate prospect of bank-notes than with the more distant prospect of\r\n",
      "the land.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not ungrateful, sir. I never meant to show disregard for any kind\r\n",
      "intentions you might have towards me. On the contrary.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very good. Then prove it. You bring me a letter from Bulstrode saying\r\n",
      "he doesn’t believe you’ve been cracking and promising to pay your debts\r\n",
      "out o’ my land, and then, if there’s any scrape you’ve got into, we’ll\r\n",

      "me your arm. I’ll try and walk round the room.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred, in spite of his irritation, had kindness enough in him to be a\r\n",
      "little sorry for the unloved, unvenerated old man, who with his\r\n",
      "dropsical legs looked more than usually pitiable in walking. While\r\n",
      "giving his arm, he thought that he should not himself like to be an old\r\n",
      "fellow with his constitution breaking up; and he waited\r\n",
      "good-temperedly, first before the window to hear the wonted remarks\r\n",
      "about the guinea-fowls and the weather-cock, and then before the scanty\r\n",
      "book-shelves, of which the chief glories in dark calf were Josephus,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“What did missy want with more books? What must you be bringing her\r\n",
      "more books for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They amuse her, sir. She is very fond of reading.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A little too fond,” said Mr. Featherstone, captiously. “She was for\r\n",
      "reading when she sat with me. But I put a stop to that. She’s got the\r\n",
      "newspaper to read out loud. That’s enough for one day, I should think.\r\n",
      "I can’t abide to see her reading to herself. You mind and not bring her\r\n",
      "any more books, do you hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I hear.” Fred had received this order before, and had\r\n",
      "secretly disobeyed it. He intended to disobey it again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ring the bell,” said Mr. Featherstone; “I want missy to come down.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond and Mary had been talking faster than their male friends. They\r\n",
      "did not think of sitting down, but stood at the toilet-table near the\r\n",
      "window while Rosamond took off her hat, adjusted her veil, and applied\r\n",
      "little touches of her finger-tips to her hair—hair of infantine\r\n",
      "fairness, neither flaxen nor yellow. Mary Garth seemed all the plainer\r\n",
      "standing at an angle between the two nymphs—the one in the glass, and\r\n",
      "the one out of it, who looked at each other with eyes of heavenly blue,\r\n",
      "deep enough to hold the most exquisite meanings an ingenious beholder\r\n",
      "could put into them, and deep enough to hide the meanings of the owner\r\n",
      "if these should happen to be less exquisite. Only a few children in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch looked blond by the side of Rosamond, and the slim figure\r\n",
      "displayed by her riding-habit had delicate undulations. In fact, most\r\n",
      "men in Middlemarch, except her brothers, held that Miss Vincy was the\r\n",
      "best girl in the world, and some called her an angel. Mary Garth, on\r\n",
      "the contrary, had the aspect of an ordinary sinner: she was brown; her\r\n",
      "curly dark hair was rough and stubborn; her stature was low; and it\r\n",
      "would not be true to declare, in satisfactory antithesis, that she had\r\n",
      "all the virtues. Plainness has its peculiar temptations and vices quite\r\n",
      "as much as beauty; it is apt either to feign amiability, or, not\r\n",
      "feigning it, to show all the repulsiveness of discontent: at any rate,\r\n",
      "to be called an ugly thing in contrast with that lovely creature your\r\n",
      "companion, is apt to produce some effect beyond a sense of fine\r\n",
      "veracity and fitness in the phrase. At the age of two-and-twenty Mary\r\n",
      "had certainly not attained that perfect good sense and good principle\r\n",
      "which are usually recommended to the less fortunate girl, as if they\r\n",
      "were to be obtained in quantities ready mixed, with a flavor of\r\n",
      "resignation as required. Her shrewdness had a streak of satiric\r\n",
      "bitterness continually renewed and never carried utterly out of sight,\r\n",
      "except by a strong current of gratitude towards those who, instead of\r\n",
      "telling her that she ought to be contented, did something to make her\r\n",
      "so. Advancing womanhood had tempered her plainness, which was of a good\r\n",
      "human sort, such as the mothers of our race have very commonly worn in\r\n",
      "all latitudes under a more or less becoming headgear. Rembrandt would\r\n",
      "have painted her with pleasure, and would have made her broad features\r\n",
      "look out of the canvas with intelligent honesty. For honesty,\r\n",
      "truth-telling fairness, was Mary’s reigning virtue: she neither tried\r\n",
      "to create illusions, nor indulged in them for her own behoof, and when\r\n",
      "she was in a good mood she had humor enough in her to laugh at herself.\r\n",
      "When she and Rosamond happened both to be reflected in the glass, she\r\n",
      "said, laughingly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a brown patch I am by the side of you, Rosy! You are the most\r\n",
      "unbecoming companion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no! No one thinks of your appearance, you are so sensible and\r\n",
      "useful, Mary. Beauty is of very little consequence in reality,” said\r\n",
      "Rosamond, turning her head towards Mary, but with eyes swerving towards\r\n",
      "the new view of her neck in the glass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You mean _my_ beauty,” said Mary, rather sardonically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond thought, “Poor Mary, she takes the kindest things ill.” Aloud\r\n",
      "she said, “What have you been doing lately?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I? Oh, minding the house—pouring out syrup—pretending to be amiable\r\n",
      "and contented—learning to have a bad opinion of everybody.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a wretched life for you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Mary, curtly, with a little toss of her head. “I think my\r\n",
      "life is pleasanter than your Miss Morgan’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; but Miss Morgan is so uninteresting, and not young.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is interesting to herself, I suppose; and I am not at all sure\r\n",
      "that everything gets easier as one gets older.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Rosamond, reflectively; “one wonders what such people do,\r\n",
      "without any prospect. To be sure, there is religion as a support. But,”\r\n",
      "she added, dimpling, “it is very different with you, Mary. You may have\r\n",
      "an offer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Has any one told you he means to make me one?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "you, seeing you almost every day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A certain change in Mary’s face was chiefly determined by the resolve\r\n",
      "not to show any change.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Does that always make people fall in love?” she answered, carelessly;\r\n",
      "“it seems to me quite as often a reason for detesting each other.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not when they are interesting and agreeable. I hear that Mr. Lydgate\r\n",
      "is both.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Mr. Lydgate!” said Mary, with an unmistakable lapse into\r\n",
      "indifference. “You want to know something about him,” she added, not\r\n",
      "choosing to indulge Rosamond’s indirectness.\r\n",

      "of Rosamond, whom old Featherstone made haste ostentatiously to\r\n",
      "introduce as his niece, though he had never thought it worth while to\r\n",
      "speak of Mary Garth in that light. Nothing escaped Lydgate in\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s graceful behavior: how delicately she waived the notice\r\n",
      "which the old man’s want of taste had thrust upon her by a quiet\r\n",
      "gravity, not showing her dimples on the wrong occasion, but showing\r\n",
      "them afterwards in speaking to Mary, to whom she addressed herself with\r\n",
      "so much good-natured interest, that Lydgate, after quickly examining\r\n",
      "Mary more fully than he had done before, saw an adorable kindness in\r\n",

      "a pretty lightness, going towards her whip, which lay at a distance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate was quick in anticipating her. He reached the whip before she\r\n",

      "of course was looking at her, and their eyes met with that peculiar\r\n",
      "meeting which is never arrived at by effort, but seems like a sudden\r\n",
      "divine clearance of haze. I think Lydgate turned a little paler than\r\n",
      "usual, but Rosamond blushed deeply and felt a certain astonishment.\r\n",
      "After that, she was really anxious to go, and did not know what sort of\r\n",
      "stupidity her uncle was talking of when she went to shake hands with\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet this result, which she took to be a mutual impression, called\r\n",
      "falling in love, was just what Rosamond had contemplated beforehand.\r\n",
      "Ever since that important new arrival in Middlemarch she had woven a\r\n",
      "little future, of which something like this scene was the necessary\r\n",
      "beginning. Strangers, whether wrecked and clinging to a raft, or duly\r\n",
      "escorted and accompanied by portmanteaus, have always had a\r\n",
      "circumstantial fascination for the virgin mind, against which native\r\n",
      "merit has urged itself in vain. And a stranger was absolutely necessary\r\n",
      "to Rosamond’s social romance, which had always turned on a lover and\r\n",
      "bridegroom who was not a Middlemarcher, and who had no connections at\r\n",
      "all like her own: of late, indeed, the construction seemed to demand\r\n",
      "that he should somehow be related to a baronet. Now that she and the\r\n",
      "stranger had met, reality proved much more moving than anticipation,\r\n",
      "and Rosamond could not doubt that this was the great epoch of her life.\r\n",
      "She judged of her own symptoms as those of awakening love, and she held\r\n",
      "it still more natural that Mr. Lydgate should have fallen in love at\r\n",
      "first sight of her. These things happened so often at balls, and why\r\n",
      "not by the morning light, when the complexion showed all the better for\r\n",
      "it? Rosamond, though no older than Mary, was rather used to being\r\n",
      "fallen in love with; but she, for her part, had remained indifferent\r\n",
      "and fastidiously critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor.\r\n",
      "And here was Mr. Lydgate suddenly corresponding to her ideal, being\r\n",
      "altogether foreign to Middlemarch, carrying a certain air of\r\n",
      "distinction congruous with good family, and possessing connections\r\n",
      "which offered vistas of that middle-class heaven, rank; a man of\r\n",
      "talent, also, whom it would be especially delightful to enslave: in\r\n",
      "fact, a man who had touched her nature quite newly, and brought a vivid\r\n",
      "interest into her life which was better than any fancied “might-be”\r\n",
      "such as she was in the habit of opposing to the actual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus, in riding home, both the brother and the sister were preoccupied\r\n",
      "and inclined to be silent. Rosamond, whose basis for her structure had\r\n",
      "the usual airy slightness, was of remarkably detailed and realistic\r\n",
      "imagination when the foundation had been once presupposed; and before\r\n",
      "they had ridden a mile she was far on in the costume and introductions\r\n",
      "of her wedded life, having determined on her house in Middlemarch, and\r\n",
      "foreseen the visits she would pay to her husband’s high-bred relatives\r\n",
      "at a distance, whose finished manners she could appropriate as\r\n",
      "thoroughly as she had done her school accomplishments, preparing\r\n",
      "herself thus for vaguer elevations which might ultimately come. There\r\n",
      "was nothing financial, still less sordid, in her previsions: she cared\r\n",
      "about what were considered refinements, and not about the money that\r\n",
      "was to pay for them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred’s mind, on the other hand, was busy with an anxiety which even his\r\n",
      "ready hopefulness could not immediately quell. He saw no way of eluding\r\n",
      "Featherstone’s stupid demand without incurring consequences which he\r\n",
      "liked less even than the task of fulfilling it. His father was already\r\n",
      "out of humor with him, and would be still more so if he were the\r\n",
      "occasion of any additional coolness between his own family and the\r\n",
      "Bulstrodes. Then, he himself hated having to go and speak to his uncle\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, and perhaps after drinking wine he had said many foolish\r\n",
      "things about Featherstone’s property, and these had been magnified by\r\n",
      "report. Fred felt that he made a wretched figure as a fellow who\r\n",
      "bragged about expectations from a queer old miser like Featherstone,\r\n",
      "and went to beg for certificates at his bidding. But—those\r\n",
      "expectations! He really had them, and he saw no agreeable alternative\r\n",
      "if he gave them up; besides, he had lately made a debt which galled him\r\n",
      "extremely, and old Featherstone had almost bargained to pay it off. The\r\n",
      "whole affair was miserably small: his debts were small, even his\r\n",
      "expectations were not anything so very magnificent. Fred had known men\r\n",
      "to whom he would have been ashamed of confessing the smallness of his\r\n",
      "scrapes. Such ruminations naturally produced a streak of misanthropic\r\n",
      "bitterness. To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and\r\n",
      "inevitable heir to nothing in particular, while such men as Mainwaring\r\n",
      "and Vyan—certainly life was a poor business, when a spirited young\r\n",
      "fellow, with a good appetite for the best of everything, had so poor an\r\n",
      "outlook.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had not occurred to Fred that the introduction of Bulstrode’s name\r\n",
      "in the matter was a fiction of old Featherstone’s; nor could this have\r\n",
      "made any difference to his position. He saw plainly enough that the old\r\n",
      "man wanted to exercise his power by tormenting him a little, and also\r\n",
      "probably to get some satisfaction out of seeing him on unpleasant terms\r\n",
      "with Bulstrode. Fred fancied that he saw to the bottom of his uncle\r\n",
      "Featherstone’s soul, though in reality half what he saw there was no\r\n",
      "more than the reflex of his own inclinations. The difficult task of\r\n",

      "chiefly made up of their own wishes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred’s main point of debate with himself was, whether he should tell\r\n",
      "his father, or try to get through the affair without his father’s\r\n",

      "one, when he was usually free from other callers. But a visitor had\r\n",
      "come in at one o’clock, and Mr. Bulstrode had so much to say to him,\r\n",
      "that there was little chance of the interview being over in half an\r\n",
      "hour. The banker’s speech was fluent, but it was also copious, and he\r\n",
      "used up an appreciable amount of time in brief meditative pauses. Do\r\n",
      "not imagine his sickly aspect to have been of the yellow, black-haired\r\n",
      "sort: he had a pale blond skin, thin gray-besprinkled brown hair,\r\n",
      "light-gray eyes, and a large forehead. Loud men called his subdued tone\r\n",

      "be given to concealment of anything except his own voice, unless it can\r\n",
      "be shown that Holy Writ has placed the seat of candor in the lungs. Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode had also a deferential bending attitude in listening, and an\r\n",
      "apparently fixed attentiveness in his eyes which made those persons who\r\n",
      "thought themselves worth hearing infer that he was seeking the utmost\r\n",
      "improvement from their discourse. Others, who expected to make no great\r\n",

      "One of Lydgate’s gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous, yet\r\n",
      "capable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment. About his\r\n",
      "ordinary bearing there was a certain fling, a fearless expectation of\r\n",
      "success, a confidence in his own powers and integrity much fortified by\r\n",
      "contempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he had had no\r\n",
      "experience. But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression\r\n",
      "of unaffected good-will. Mr. Bulstrode perhaps liked him the better for\r\n",
      "the difference between them in pitch and manners; he certainly liked\r\n",
      "him the better, as Rosamond did, for being a stranger in Middlemarch.\r\n",

      "determined that so great an object shall not be shackled by our two\r\n",
      "physicians. Indeed, I am encouraged to consider your advent to this\r\n",
      "town as a gracious indication that a more manifest blessing is now to\r\n",
      "be awarded to my efforts, which have hitherto been much withstood. With\r\n",
      "regard to the old infirmary, we have gained the initial point—I mean\r\n",
      "your election. And now I hope you will not shrink from incurring a\r\n",
      "certain amount of jealousy and dislike from your professional brethren\r\n",
      "by presenting yourself as a reformer.”\r\n",

      "“I will not profess bravery,” said Lydgate, smiling, “but I acknowledge\r\n",
      "a good deal of pleasure in fighting, and I should not care for my\r\n",

      "said the banker. “I mean in knowledge and skill; not in social status,\r\n",
      "for our medical men are most of them connected with respectable\r\n",
      "townspeople here. My own imperfect health has induced me to give some\r\n",
      "attention to those palliative resources which the divine mercy has\r\n",
      "placed within our reach. I have consulted eminent men in the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes;—with our present medical rules and education, one must be\r\n",

      "higher questions which determine the starting-point of a diagnosis—as\r\n",
      "to the philosophy of medical evidence—any glimmering of these can only\r\n",
      "come from a scientific culture of which country practitioners have\r\n",
      "usually no more notion than the man in the moon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode, bending and looking intently, found the form which\r\n",
      "Lydgate had given to his agreement not quite suited to his\r\n",
      "comprehension. Under such circumstances a judicious man changes the\r\n",
      "topic and enters on ground where his own gifts may be more useful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "vary in sentiment as to a measure in which you are not likely to be\r\n",
      "actively concerned, but in which your sympathetic concurrence may be an\r\n",

      "in your patients?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "different minds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Precisely. And on such subjects wrong teaching is as fatal as no\r\n",
      "teaching. Now a point which I have much at heart to secure is a new\r\n",
      "regulation as to clerical attendance at the old infirmary. The building\r\n",
      "stands in Mr. Farebrother’s parish. You know Mr. Farebrother?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have seen him. He gave me his vote. I must call to thank him. He\r\n",

      "naturalist.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Farebrother, my dear sir, is a man deeply painful to contemplate.\r\n",

      "talents.” Mr. Bulstrode paused and looked meditative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have not yet been pained by finding any excessive talent in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch,” said Lydgate, bluntly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What I desire,” Mr. Bulstrode continued, looking still more serious,\r\n",
      "“is that Mr. Farebrother’s attendance at the hospital should be\r\n",
      "superseded by the appointment of a chaplain—of Mr. Tyke, in fact—and\r\n",
      "that no other spiritual aid should be called in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As a medical man I could have no opinion on such a point unless I knew\r\n",
      "Mr. Tyke, and even then I should require to know the cases in which he\r\n",
      "was applied.” Lydgate smiled, but he was bent on being circumspect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course you cannot enter fully into the merits of this measure at\r\n",
      "present. But”—here Mr. Bulstrode began to speak with a more chiselled\r\n",
      "emphasis—“the subject is likely to be referred to the medical board of\r\n",
      "the infirmary, and what I trust I may ask of you is, that in virtue of\r\n",
      "the cooperation between us which I now look forward to, you will not,\r\n",
      "so far as you are concerned, be influenced by my opponents in this\r\n",
      "matter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope I shall have nothing to do with clerical disputes,” said\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“My responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, is of a broader kind. With me, indeed,\r\n",
      "this question is one of sacred accountableness; whereas with my\r\n",
      "opponents, I have good reason to say that it is an occasion for\r\n",
      "gratifying a spirit of worldly opposition. But I shall not therefore\r\n",
      "drop one iota of my convictions, or cease to identify myself with that\r\n",
      "truth which an evil generation hates. I have devoted myself to this\r\n",
      "object of hospital-improvement, but I will boldly confess to you, Mr.\r\n",
      "Lydgate, that I should have no interest in hospitals if I believed that\r\n",
      "nothing more was concerned therein than the cure of mortal diseases. I\r\n",
      "have another ground of action, and in the face of persecution I will\r\n",
      "not conceal it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the last words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There we certainly differ,” said Lydgate. But he was not sorry that\r\n",
      "the door was now opened, and Mr. Vincy was announced. That florid\r\n",
      "sociable personage was become more interesting to him since he had seen\r\n",
      "Rosamond. Not that, like her, he had been weaving any future in which\r\n",
      "their lots were united; but a man naturally remembers a charming girl\r\n",
      "with pleasure, and is willing to dine where he may see her again.\r\n",
      "Before he took leave, Mr. Vincy had given that invitation which he had\r\n",
      "been “in no hurry about,” for Rosamond at breakfast had mentioned that\r\n",
      "she thought her uncle Featherstone had taken the new doctor into great\r\n",
      "favor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode, alone with his brother-in-law, poured himself out a\r\n",
      "glass of water, and opened a sandwich-box.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot persuade you to adopt my regimen, Vincy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no; I’ve no opinion of that system. Life wants padding,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Vincy, unable to omit his portable theory. “However,” he went on,\r\n",
      "accenting the word, as if to dismiss all irrelevance, “what I came here\r\n",
      "to talk about was a little affair of my young scapegrace, Fred’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is a subject on which you and I are likely to take quite as\r\n",
      "different views as on diet, Vincy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope not this time.” (Mr. Vincy was resolved to be good-humored.)\r\n",
      "“The fact is, it’s about a whim of old Featherstone’s. Somebody has\r\n",
      "been cooking up a story out of spite, and telling it to the old man, to\r\n",
      "try to set him against Fred. He’s very fond of Fred, and is likely to\r\n",
      "do something handsome for him; indeed he has as good as told Fred that\r\n",
      "he means to leave him his land, and that makes other people jealous.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Vincy, I must repeat, that you will not get any concurrence from me as\r\n",
      "to the course you have pursued with your eldest son. It was entirely\r\n",
      "from worldly vanity that you destined him for the Church: with a family\r\n",
      "of three sons and four daughters, you were not warranted in devoting\r\n",
      "money to an expensive education which has succeeded in nothing but in\r\n",
      "giving him extravagant idle habits. You are now reaping the\r\n",
      "consequences.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To point out other people’s errors was a duty that Mr. Bulstrode rarely\r\n",
      "shrank from, but Mr. Vincy was not equally prepared to be patient. When\r\n",
      "a man has the immediate prospect of being mayor, and is ready, in the\r\n",
      "interests of commerce, to take up a firm attitude on politics\r\n",
      "generally, he has naturally a sense of his importance to the framework\r\n",
      "of things which seems to throw questions of private conduct into the\r\n",
      "background. And this particular reproof irritated him more than any\r\n",
      "other. It was eminently superfluous to him to be told that he was\r\n",
      "reaping the consequences. But he felt his neck under Bulstrode’s yoke;\r\n",
      "and though he usually enjoyed kicking, he was anxious to refrain from\r\n",
      "that relief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As to that, Bulstrode, it’s no use going back. I’m not one of your\r\n",
      "pattern men, and I don’t pretend to be. I couldn’t foresee everything\r\n",
      "in the trade; there wasn’t a finer business in Middlemarch than ours,\r\n",
      "and the lad was clever. My poor brother was in the Church, and would\r\n",
      "have done well—had got preferment already, but that stomach fever took\r\n",
      "him off: else he might have been a dean by this time. I think I was\r\n",
      "justified in what I tried to do for Fred. If you come to religion, it\r\n",
      "seems to me a man shouldn’t want to carve out his meat to an ounce\r\n",
      "beforehand:—one must trust a little to Providence and be generous. It’s\r\n",
      "a good British feeling to try and raise your family a little: in my\r\n",
      "opinion, it’s a father’s duty to give his sons a fine chance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t wish to act otherwise than as your best friend, Vincy, when I\r\n",

      "worldliness and inconsistent folly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well,” said Mr. Vincy, kicking in spite of resolutions, “I never\r\n",

      "anybody else who is not worldly. I suppose you don’t conduct business\r\n",
      "on what you call unworldly principles. The only difference I see is\r\n",
      "that one worldliness is a little bit honester than another.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This kind of discussion is unfruitful, Vincy,” said Mr. Bulstrode,\r\n",
      "who, finishing his sandwich, had thrown himself back in his chair, and\r\n",
      "shaded his eyes as if weary. “You had some more particular business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes. The long and short of it is, somebody has told old\r\n",

      "or trying to borrow money on the prospect of his land. Of course you\r\n",
      "never said any such nonsense. But the old fellow will insist on it that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The old gentleman was staying in bed on account of the cold weather,\r\n",
      "and as Mary Garth was not to be seen in the sitting-room, Fred went\r\n",
      "up-stairs immediately and presented the letter to his uncle, who,\r\n",
      "propped up comfortably on a bed-rest, was not less able than usual to\r\n",
      "enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating\r\n",
      "mankind. He put on his spectacles to read the letter, pursing up his\r\n",
      "lips and drawing down their corners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Under the circumstances I will not decline to state my\r\n",
      "conviction_—tchah! what fine words the fellow puts! He’s as fine as an\r\n",
      "auctioneer—_that your son Frederic has not obtained any advance of\r\n",
      "money on bequests promised by Mr. Featherstone_—promised? who said I\r\n",
      "had ever promised? I promise nothing—I shall make codicils as long as I\r\n",
      "like—_and that considering the nature of such a proceeding, it is\r\n",
      "unreasonable to presume that a young man of sense and character would\r\n",
      "attempt it_—ah, but the gentleman doesn’t say you are a young man of\r\n",
      "sense and character, mark you that, sir!—_As to my own concern with any\r\n",
      "report of such a nature, I distinctly affirm that I never made any\r\n",
      "statement to the effect that your son had borrowed money on any\r\n",
      "property that might accrue to him on Mr. Featherstone’s demise_—bless\r\n",
      "my heart! ‘property’—accrue—demise! Lawyer Standish is nothing to him.\r\n",
      "He couldn’t speak finer if he wanted to borrow. Well,” Mr. Featherstone\r\n",
      "here looked over his spectacles at Fred, while he handed back the\r\n",
      "letter to him with a contemptuous gesture, “you don’t suppose I believe\r\n",
      "a thing because Bulstrode writes it out fine, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred colored. “You wished to have the letter, sir. I should think it\r\n",
      "very likely that Mr. Bulstrode’s denial is as good as the authority\r\n",
      "which told you what he denies.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Every bit. I never said I believed either one or the other. And now\r\n",
      "what d’ you expect?” said Mr. Featherstone, curtly, keeping on his\r\n",
      "spectacles, but withdrawing his hands under his wraps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I expect nothing, sir.” Fred with difficulty restrained himself from\r\n",
      "venting his irritation. “I came to bring you the letter. If you like I\r\n",
      "will bid you good morning.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not yet, not yet. Ring the bell; I want missy to come.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a servant who came in answer to the bell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell missy to come!” said Mr. Featherstone, impatiently. “What\r\n",
      "business had she to go away?” He spoke in the same tone when Mary came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why couldn’t you sit still here till I told you to go? I want my\r\n",
      "waistcoat now. I told you always to put it on the bed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary’s eyes looked rather red, as if she had been crying. It was clear\r\n",
      "that Mr. Featherstone was in one of his most snappish humors this\r\n",
      "morning, and though Fred had now the prospect of receiving the\r\n",
      "much-needed present of money, he would have preferred being free to\r\n",
      "turn round on the old tyrant and tell him that Mary Garth was too good\r\n",
      "to be at his beck. Though Fred had risen as she entered the room, she\r\n",
      "had barely noticed him, and looked as if her nerves were quivering with\r\n",
      "the expectation that something would be thrown at her. But she never\r\n",
      "had anything worse than words to dread. When she went to reach the\r\n",
      "waistcoat from a peg, Fred went up to her and said, “Allow me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let it alone! You bring it, missy, and lay it down here,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Featherstone. “Now you go away again till I call you,” he added, when\r\n",
      "the waistcoat was laid down by him. It was usual with him to season his\r\n",
      "pleasure in showing favor to one person by being especially\r\n",
      "disagreeable to another, and Mary was always at hand to furnish the\r\n",
      "condiment. When his own relatives came she was treated better. Slowly\r\n",
      "he took out a bunch of keys from the waistcoat pocket, and slowly he\r\n",
      "drew forth a tin box which was under the bed-clothes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You expect I am going to give you a little fortune, eh?” he said,\r\n",
      "looking above his spectacles and pausing in the act of opening the lid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all, sir. You were good enough to speak of making me a present\r\n",
      "the other day, else, of course, I should not have thought of the\r\n",
      "matter.” But Fred was of a hopeful disposition, and a vision had\r\n",
      "presented itself of a sum just large enough to deliver him from a\r\n",
      "certain anxiety. When Fred got into debt, it always seemed to him\r\n",
      "highly probable that something or other—he did not necessarily conceive\r\n",
      "what—would come to pass enabling him to pay in due time. And now that\r\n",
      "the providential occurrence was apparently close at hand, it would have\r\n",
      "been sheer absurdity to think that the supply would be short of the\r\n",
      "need: as absurd as a faith that believed in half a miracle for want of\r\n",
      "strength to believe in a whole one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The deep-veined hands fingered many bank-notes one after the other,\r\n",
      "laying them down flat again, while Fred leaned back in his chair,\r\n",
      "scorning to look eager. He held himself to be a gentleman at heart, and\r\n",
      "did not like courting an old fellow for his money. At last, Mr.\r\n",
      "Featherstone eyed him again over his spectacles and presented him with\r\n",
      "a little sheaf of notes: Fred could see distinctly that there were but\r\n",
      "five, as the less significant edges gaped towards him. But then, each\r\n",
      "might mean fifty pounds. He took them, saying—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very much obliged to you, sir,” and was going to roll them up\r\n",
      "without seeming to think of their value. But this did not suit Mr.\r\n",
      "Featherstone, who was eying him intently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, don’t you think it worth your while to count ’em? You take money\r\n",
      "like a lord; I suppose you lose it like one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought I was not to look a gift-horse in the mouth, sir. But I\r\n",
      "shall be very happy to count them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred was not so happy, however, after he had counted them. For they\r\n",
      "actually presented the absurdity of being less than his hopefulness had\r\n",
      "decided that they must be. What can the fitness of things mean, if not\r\n",
      "their fitness to a man’s expectations? Failing this, absurdity and\r\n",
      "atheism gape behind him. The collapse for Fred was severe when he found\r\n",
      "that he held no more than five twenties, and his share in the higher\r\n",
      "education of this country did not seem to help him. Nevertheless he\r\n",
      "said, with rapid changes in his fair complexion—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is very handsome of you, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should think it is,” said Mr. Featherstone, locking his box and\r\n",
      "replacing it, then taking off his spectacles deliberately, and at\r\n",
      "length, as if his inward meditation had more deeply convinced him,\r\n",
      "repeating, “I should think it handsome.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I assure you, sir, I am very grateful,” said Fred, who had had time to\r\n",
      "recover his cheerful air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So you ought to be. You want to cut a figure in the world, and I\r\n",
      "reckon Peter Featherstone is the only one you’ve got to trust to.” Here\r\n",
      "the old man’s eyes gleamed with a curiously mingled satisfaction in the\r\n",
      "consciousness that this smart young fellow relied upon him, and that\r\n",
      "the smart young fellow was rather a fool for doing so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed: I was not born to very splendid chances. Few men have\r\n",
      "been more cramped than I have been,” said Fred, with some sense of\r\n",
      "surprise at his own virtue, considering how hardly he was dealt with.\r\n",
      "“It really seems a little too bad to have to ride a broken-winded\r\n",
      "hunter, and see men, who, are not half such good judges as yourself,\r\n",
      "able to throw away any amount of money on buying bad bargains.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you can buy yourself a fine hunter now. Eighty pound is enough\r\n",
      "for that, I reckon—and you’ll have twenty pound over to get yourself\r\n",
      "out of any little scrape,” said Mr. Featherstone, chuckling slightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are very good, sir,” said Fred, with a fine sense of contrast\r\n",
      "between the words and his feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, rather a better uncle than your fine uncle Bulstrode. You won’t\r\n",
      "get much out of his spekilations, I think. He’s got a pretty strong\r\n",
      "string round your father’s leg, by what I hear, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My father never tells me anything about his affairs, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, he shows some sense there. But other people find ’em out without\r\n",
      "his telling. _He’ll_ never have much to leave you: he’ll most-like die\r\n",
      "without a will—he’s the sort of man to do it—let ’em make him mayor of\r\n",
      "Middlemarch as much as they like. But you won’t get much by his dying\r\n",
      "without a will, though you _are_ the eldest son.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred thought that Mr. Featherstone had never been so disagreeable\r\n",
      "before. True, he had never before given him quite so much money at\r\n",
      "once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall I destroy this letter of Mr. Bulstrode’s, sir?” said Fred,\r\n",
      "rising with the letter as if he would put it in the fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, ay, I don’t want it. It’s worth no money to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred carried the letter to the fire, and thrust the poker through it\r\n",
      "with much zest. He longed to get out of the room, but he was a little\r\n",
      "ashamed before his inner self, as well as before his uncle, to run away\r\n",
      "immediately after pocketing the money. Presently, the farm-bailiff came\r\n",
      "up to give his master a report, and Fred, to his unspeakable relief,\r\n",
      "was dismissed with the injunction to come again soon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had longed not only to be set free from his uncle, but also to find\r\n",
      "Mary Garth. She was now in her usual place by the fire, with sewing in\r\n",
      "her hands and a book open on the little table by her side. Her eyelids\r\n",
      "had lost some of their redness now, and she had her usual air of\r\n",
      "self-command.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Am I wanted up-stairs?” she said, half rising as Fred entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; I am only dismissed, because Simmons is gone up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary sat down again, and resumed her work. She was certainly treating\r\n",
      "him with more indifference than usual: she did not know how\r\n",
      "affectionately indignant he had felt on her behalf up-stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I stay here a little, Mary, or shall I bore you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray sit down,” said Mary; “you will not be so heavy a bore as Mr.\r\n",
      "John Waule, who was here yesterday, and he sat down without asking my\r\n",
      "leave.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor fellow! I think he is in love with you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not aware of it. And to me it is one of the most odious things in\r\n",
      "a girl’s life, that there must always be some supposition of falling in\r\n",
      "love coming between her and any man who is kind to her, and to whom she\r\n",
      "is grateful. I should have thought that I, at least, might have been\r\n",
      "safe from all that. I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity of\r\n",
      "fancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary did not mean to betray any feeling, but in spite of herself she\r\n",
      "ended in a tremulous tone of vexation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Confound John Waule! I did not mean to make you angry. I didn’t know\r\n",
      "you had any reason for being grateful to me. I forgot what a great\r\n",
      "service you think it if any one snuffs a candle for you.” Fred also had\r\n",
      "his pride, and was not going to show that he knew what had called forth\r\n",
      "this outburst of Mary’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I am not angry, except with the ways of the world. I do like to be\r\n",
      "spoken to as if I had common-sense. I really often feel as if I could\r\n",
      "understand a little more than I ever hear even from young gentlemen who\r\n",
      "have been to college.” Mary had recovered, and she spoke with a\r\n",
      "suppressed rippling under-current of laughter pleasant to hear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t care how merry you are at my expense this morning,” said Fred,\r\n",
      "“I thought you looked so sad when you came up-stairs. It is a shame you\r\n",
      "should stay here to be bullied in that way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I have an easy life—by comparison. I have tried being a teacher,\r\n",
      "and I am not fit for that: my mind is too fond of wandering on its own\r\n",
      "way. I think any hardship is better than pretending to do what one is\r\n",
      "paid for, and never really doing it. Everything here I can do as well\r\n",
      "as any one else could; perhaps better than some—Rosy, for example.\r\n",
      "Though she is just the sort of beautiful creature that is imprisoned\r\n",
      "with ogres in fairy tales.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Rosy!_” cried Fred, in a tone of profound brotherly scepticism.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, Fred!” said Mary, emphatically; “you have no right to be so\r\n",
      "critical.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you mean anything particular—just now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I mean something general—always.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, that I am idle and extravagant. Well, I am not fit to be a poor\r\n",
      "man. I should not have made a bad fellow if I had been rich.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You would have done your duty in that state of life to which it has\r\n",
      "not pleased God to call you,” said Mary, laughing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I couldn’t do my duty as a clergyman, any more than you could do\r\n",
      "yours as a governess. You ought to have a little fellow-feeling there,\r\n",
      "Mary.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I never said you ought to be a clergyman. There are other sorts of\r\n",
      "work. It seems to me very miserable not to resolve on some course and\r\n",
      "act accordingly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So I could, if—” Fred broke off, and stood up, leaning against the\r\n",
      "mantel-piece.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you were sure you should not have a fortune?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not say that. You want to quarrel with me. It is too bad of you\r\n",
      "to be guided by what other people say about me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can I want to quarrel with you? I should be quarrelling with all\r\n",
      "my new books,” said Mary, lifting the volume on the table. “However\r\n",
      "naughty you may be to other people, you are good to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because I like you better than any one else. But I know you despise\r\n",
      "me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I do—a little,” said Mary, nodding, with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You would admire a stupendous fellow, who would have wise opinions\r\n",
      "about everything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I should.” Mary was sewing swiftly, and seemed provokingly\r\n",
      "mistress of the situation. When a conversation has taken a wrong turn\r\n",
      "for us, we only get farther and farther into the swamp of awkwardness.\r\n",
      "This was what Fred Vincy felt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose a woman is never in love with any one she has always\r\n",
      "known—ever since she can remember; as a man often is. It is always some\r\n",
      "new fellow who strikes a girl.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me see,” said Mary, the corners of her mouth curling archly; “I\r\n",
      "must go back on my experience. There is Juliet—she seems an example of\r\n",
      "what you say. But then Ophelia had probably known Hamlet a long while;\r\n",
      "and Brenda Troil—she had known Mordaunt Merton ever since they were\r\n",
      "children; but then he seems to have been an estimable young man; and\r\n",
      "Minna was still more deeply in love with Cleveland, who was a stranger.\r\n",
      "Waverley was new to Flora MacIvor; but then she did not fall in love\r\n",
      "with him. And there are Olivia and Sophia Primrose, and Corinne—they\r\n",
      "may be said to have fallen in love with new men. Altogether, my\r\n",
      "experience is rather mixed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary looked up with some roguishness at Fred, and that look of hers was\r\n",
      "very dear to him, though the eyes were nothing more than clear windows\r\n",
      "where observation sat laughingly. He was certainly an affectionate\r\n",
      "fellow, and as he had grown from boy to man, he had grown in love with\r\n",
      "his old playmate, notwithstanding that share in the higher education of\r\n",
      "the country which had exalted his views of rank and income.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "a ready understanding, but no spark had yet kindled in him an\r\n",
      "intellectual passion; knowledge seemed to him a very superficial\r\n",
      "affair, easily mastered: judging from the conversation of his elders,\r\n",
      "he had apparently got already more than was necessary for mature life.\r\n",
      "Probably this was not an exceptional result of expensive teaching at\r\n",
      "that period of short-waisted coats, and other fashions which have not\r\n",
      "yet recurred. But, one vacation, a wet day sent him to the small home\r\n",

      "for him: in vain! unless, indeed, he took down a dusty row of volumes\r\n",
      "with gray-paper backs and dingy labels—the volumes of an old\r\n",
      "Cyclopaedia which he had never disturbed. It would at least be a\r\n",
      "novelty to disturb them. They were on the highest shelf, and he stood\r\n",
      "on a chair to get them down. But he opened the volume which he first\r\n",
      "took from the shelf: somehow, one is apt to read in a makeshift\r\n",
      "attitude, just where it might seem inconvenient to do so. The page he\r\n",
      "opened on was under the head of Anatomy, and the first passage that\r\n",
      "drew his eyes was on the valves of the heart. He was not much\r\n",
      "acquainted with valves of any sort, but he knew that valvae were\r\n",
      "folding-doors, and through this crevice came a sudden light startling\r\n",
      "him with his first vivid notion of finely adjusted mechanism in the\r\n",
      "human frame. A liberal education had of course left him free to read\r\n",
      "the indecent passages in the school classics, but beyond a general\r\n",
      "sense of secrecy and obscenity in connection with his internal\r\n",
      "structure, had left his imagination quite unbiassed, so that for\r\n",
      "anything he knew his brains lay in small bags at his temples, and he\r\n",
      "had no more thought of representing to himself how his blood circulated\r\n",
      "than how paper served instead of gold. But the moment of vocation had\r\n",
      "come, and before he got down from his chair, the world was made new to\r\n",
      "him by a presentiment of endless processes filling the vast spaces\r\n",
      "planked out of his sight by that wordy ignorance which he had supposed\r\n",
      "to be knowledge. From that hour Lydgate felt the growth of an\r\n",
      "intellectual passion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We are not afraid of telling over and over again how a man comes to\r\n",
      "fall in love with a woman and be wedded to her, or else be fatally\r\n",
      "parted from her. Is it due to excess of poetry or of stupidity that we\r\n",
      "are never weary of describing what King James called a woman’s “makdom\r\n",
      "and her fairnesse,” never weary of listening to the twanging of the old\r\n",
      "Troubadour strings, and are comparatively uninterested in that other\r\n",
      "kind of “makdom and fairnesse” which must be wooed with industrious\r\n",
      "thought and patient renunciation of small desires? In the story of this\r\n",
      "passion, too, the development varies: sometimes it is the glorious\r\n",
      "marriage, sometimes frustration and final parting. And not seldom the\r\n",
      "catastrophe is bound up with the other passion, sung by the\r\n",
      "Troubadours. For in the multitude of middle-aged men who go about their\r\n",
      "vocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same way as\r\n",
      "the tie of their cravats, there is always a good number who once meant\r\n",
      "to shape their own deeds and alter the world a little. The story of\r\n",
      "their coming to be shapen after the average and fit to be packed by the\r\n",
      "gross, is hardly ever told even in their consciousness; for perhaps\r\n",
      "their ardor in generous unpaid toil cooled as imperceptibly as the\r\n",
      "ardor of other youthful loves, till one day their earlier self walked\r\n",
      "like a ghost in its old home and made the new furniture ghastly.\r\n",
      "Nothing in the world more subtle than the process of their gradual\r\n",
      "change! In the beginning they inhaled it unknowingly: you and I may\r\n",
      "have sent some of our breath towards infecting them, when we uttered\r\n",

      "Lydgate did not mean to be one of those failures, and there was the\r\n",
      "better hope of him because his scientific interest soon took the form\r\n",
      "of a professional enthusiasm: he had a youthful belief in his\r\n",
      "bread-winning work, not to be stifled by that initiation in makeshift\r\n",
      "called his ’prentice days; and he carried to his studies in London,\r\n",
      "Edinburgh, and Paris, the conviction that the medical profession as it\r\n",
      "might be was the finest in the world; presenting the most perfect\r\n",
      "interchange between science and art; offering the most direct alliance\r\n",
      "between intellectual conquest and the social good. Lydgate’s nature\r\n",
      "demanded this combination: he was an emotional creature, with a\r\n",
      "flesh-and-blood sense of fellowship which withstood all the\r\n",
      "abstractions of special study. He cared not only for “cases,” but for\r\n",
      "John and Elizabeth, especially Elizabeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was another attraction in his profession: it wanted reform, and\r\n",
      "gave a man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to reject its\r\n",
      "venal decorations and other humbug, and to be the possessor of genuine\r\n",
      "though undemanded qualifications. He went to study in Paris with the\r\n",
      "determination that when he came home again he would settle in some\r\n",
      "provincial town as a general practitioner, and resist the irrational\r\n",
      "severance between medical and surgical knowledge in the interest of his\r\n",
      "own scientific pursuits, as well as of the general advance: he would\r\n",
      "keep away from the range of London intrigues, jealousies, and social\r\n",
      "truckling, and win celebrity, however slowly, as Jenner had done, by\r\n",
      "the independent value of his work. For it must be remembered that this\r\n",
      "was a dark period; and in spite of venerable colleges which used great\r\n",
      "efforts to secure purity of knowledge by making it scarce, and to\r\n",
      "exclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in relation to fees and\r\n",
      "appointments, it happened that very ignorant young gentlemen were\r\n",
      "promoted in town, and many more got a legal right to practise over\r\n",
      "large areas in the country. Also, the high standard held up to the\r\n",
      "public mind by the College of Physicians, which gave its peculiar\r\n",
      "sanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical instruction\r\n",
      "obtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, did not hinder quackery\r\n",
      "from having an excellent time of it; for since professional practice\r\n",
      "chiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs, the public inferred\r\n",
      "that it might be better off with more drugs still, if they could only\r\n",
      "be got cheaply, and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic\r\n",
      "prescribed by unscrupulous ignorance which had taken no degrees.\r\n",
      "Considering that statistics had not yet embraced a calculation as to\r\n",
      "the number of ignorant or canting doctors which absolutely must exist\r\n",
      "in the teeth of all changes, it seemed to Lydgate that a change in the\r\n",
      "units was the most direct mode of changing the numbers. He meant to be\r\n",
      "a unit who would make a certain amount of difference towards that\r\n",
      "spreading change which would one day tell appreciably upon the\r\n",
      "averages, and in the mean time have the pleasure of making an\r\n",
      "advantageous difference to the viscera of his own patients. But he did\r\n",
      "not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He\r\n",
      "was ambitious of a wider effect: he was fired with the possibility that\r\n",
      "he might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link\r\n",
      "in the chain of discovery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Does it seem incongruous to you that a Middlemarch surgeon should dream\r\n",
      "of himself as a discoverer? Most of us, indeed, know little of the\r\n",
      "great originators until they have been lifted up among the\r\n",
      "constellations and already rule our fates. But that Herschel, for\r\n",
      "example, who “broke the barriers of the heavens”—did he not once play a\r\n",
      "provincial church-organ, and give music-lessons to stumbling pianists?\r\n",
      "Each of those Shining Ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who\r\n",
      "perhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything\r\n",
      "which was to give him a title to everlasting fame: each of them had his\r\n",
      "little local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and\r\n",
      "sordid cares, which made the retarding friction of his course towards\r\n",
      "final companionship with the immortals. Lydgate was not blind to the\r\n",
      "dangers of such friction, but he had plenty of confidence in his\r\n",
      "resolution to avoid it as far as possible: being seven-and-twenty, he\r\n",
      "felt himself experienced. And he was not going to have his vanities\r\n",
      "provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital,\r\n",
      "but to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of\r\n",
      "a great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice\r\n",
      "of his profession. There was fascination in the hope that the two\r\n",
      "purposes would illuminate each other: the careful observation and\r\n",
      "inference which was his daily work, the use of the lens to further his\r\n",
      "judgment in special cases, would further his thought as an instrument\r\n",
      "of larger inquiry. Was not this the typical pre-eminence of his\r\n",
      "profession? He would be a good Middlemarch doctor, and by that very\r\n",
      "means keep himself in the track of far-reaching investigation. On one\r\n",
      "point he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his\r\n",
      "career: he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make\r\n",
      "a profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are\r\n",
      "exposing adulteration, or hold shares in a gambling-hell that they may\r\n",
      "have leisure to represent the cause of public morality. He intended to\r\n",
      "begin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite\r\n",
      "certainly within his reach, and much less of a problem than the\r\n",
      "demonstrating of an anatomical conception. One of these reforms was to\r\n",
      "act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision, and simply\r\n",
      "prescribe, without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from\r\n",
      "druggists. This was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the\r\n",
      "style of general practitioner in a country town, and would be felt as\r\n",
      "offensive criticism by his professional brethren. But Lydgate meant to\r\n",
      "innovate in his treatment also, and he was wise enough to see that the\r\n",
      "best security for his practising honestly according to his belief was\r\n",
      "to get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than\r\n",

      "were wrecked, might alight on a new kingdom; and about 1829 the dark\r\n",
      "territories of Pathology were a fine America for a spirited young\r\n",
      "adventurer. Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards\r\n",
      "enlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession. The more he\r\n",
      "became interested in special questions of disease, such as the nature\r\n",
      "of fever or fevers, the more keenly he felt the need for that\r\n",
      "fundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the\r\n",
      "century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of\r\n",
      "Bichat, who died when he was only one-and-thirty, but, like another\r\n",

      "fundamentally considered, are not associations of organs which can be\r\n",
      "understood by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally;\r\n",
      "but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues,\r\n",
      "out of which the various organs—brain, heart, lungs, and so on—are\r\n",
      "compacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in\r\n",
      "various proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the rest,\r\n",
      "each material having its peculiar composition and proportions. No man,\r\n",
      "one sees, can understand and estimate the entire structure or its\r\n",
      "parts—what are its frailties and what its repairs, without knowing the\r\n",
      "nature of the materials. And the conception wrought out by Bichat, with\r\n",
      "his detailed study of the different tissues, acted necessarily on\r\n",
      "medical questions as the turning of gas-light would act on a dim,\r\n",
      "oil-lit street, showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of\r\n",
      "structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms\r\n",
      "of maladies and the action of medicaments. But results which depend on\r\n",
      "human conscience and intelligence work slowly, and now at the end of\r\n",
      "1829, most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the\r\n",
      "old paths, and there was still scientific work to be done which might\r\n",
      "have seemed to be a direct sequence of Bichat’s. This great seer did\r\n",
      "not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the\r\n",
      "living organism, marking the limit of anatomical analysis; but it was\r\n",
      "open to another mind to say, have not these structures some common\r\n",
      "basis from which they have all started, as your sarsnet, gauze, net,\r\n",
      "satin, and velvet from the raw cocoon? Here would be another light, as\r\n",
      "of oxy-hydrogen, showing the very grain of things, and revising all\r\n",
      "former explanations. Of this sequence to Bichat’s work, already\r\n",
      "vibrating along many currents of the European mind, Lydgate was\r\n",
      "enamoured; he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of\r\n",
      "living structure, and help to define men’s thought more accurately\r\n",
      "after the true order. The work had not yet been done, but only prepared\r\n",
      "for those who knew how to use the preparation. What was the primitive\r\n",
      "tissue? In that way Lydgate put the question—not quite in the way\r\n",
      "required by the awaiting answer; but such missing of the right word\r\n",
      "befalls many seekers. And he counted on quiet intervals to be\r\n",
      "watchfully seized, for taking up the threads of investigation—on many\r\n",
      "hints to be won from diligent application, not only of the scalpel, but\r\n",
      "of the microscope, which research had begun to use again with new\r\n",
      "enthusiasm of reliance. Such was Lydgate’s plan of his future: to do\r\n",
      "good small work for Middlemarch, and great work for the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was certainly a happy fellow at this time: to be seven-and-twenty,\r\n",
      "without any fixed vices, with a generous resolution that his action\r\n",
      "should be beneficent, and with ideas in his brain that made life\r\n",
      "interesting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic\r\n",
      "rites of costly observance, which the eight hundred pounds left him\r\n",
      "after buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying\r\n",
      "for. He was at a starting-point which makes many a man’s career a fine\r\n",
      "subject for betting, if there were any gentlemen given to that\r\n",
      "amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an\r\n",
      "arduous purpose, with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of\r\n",
      "circumstance, all the niceties of inward balance, by which a man swims\r\n",
      "and makes his point or else is carried headlong. The risk would remain\r\n",
      "even with close knowledge of Lydgate’s character; for character too is\r\n",
      "a process and an unfolding. The man was still in the making, as much as\r\n",
      "the Middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer, and there were both\r\n",
      "virtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding. The faults will\r\n",
      "not, I hope, be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him.\r\n",
      "Among our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little\r\n",
      "too self-confident and disdainful; whose distinguished mind is a little\r\n",
      "spotted with commonness; who is a little pinched here and protuberant\r\n",
      "there with native prejudices; or whose better energies are liable to\r\n",
      "lapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient\r\n",
      "solicitations? All these things might be alleged against Lydgate, but\r\n",
      "then, they are the periphrases of a polite preacher, who talks of Adam,\r\n",
      "and would not like to mention anything painful to the pew-renters. The\r\n",
      "particular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled\r\n",
      "have distinguishable physiognomies, diction, accent, and grimaces;\r\n",
      "filling up parts in very various dramas. Our vanities differ as our\r\n",
      "noses do: all conceit is not the same conceit, but varies in\r\n",
      "correspondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us\r\n",
      "differs from another. Lydgate’s conceit was of the arrogant sort, never\r\n",
      "simpering, never impertinent, but massive in its claims and\r\n",
      "benevolently contemptuous. He would do a great deal for noodles, being\r\n",
      "sorry for them, and feeling quite sure that they could have no power\r\n",
      "over him: he had thought of joining the Saint Simonians when he was in\r\n",
      "Paris, in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines. All\r\n",
      "his faults were marked by kindred traits, and were those of a man who\r\n",
      "had a fine baritone, whose clothes hung well upon him, and who even in\r\n",
      "his ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction. Where then lay\r\n",
      "the spots of commonness? says a young lady enamoured of that careless\r\n",
      "grace. How could there be any commonness in a man so well-bred, so\r\n",
      "ambitious of social distinction, so generous and unusual in his views\r\n",
      "of social duty? As easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius\r\n",
      "if you take him unawares on the wrong subject, or as many a man who has\r\n",
      "the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill-inspired in\r\n",
      "imagining its lighter pleasures; unable to go beyond Offenbach’s music,\r\n",
      "or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque. Lydgate’s spots of\r\n",
      "commonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices, which, in spite of\r\n",
      "noble intention and sympathy, were half of them such as are found in\r\n",
      "ordinary men of the world: that distinction of mind which belonged to\r\n",
      "his intellectual ardor, did not penetrate his feeling and judgment\r\n",
      "about furniture, or women, or the desirability of its being known\r\n",
      "(without his telling) that he was better born than other country\r\n",
      "surgeons. He did not mean to think of furniture at present; but\r\n",
      "whenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes\r\n",
      "of reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there\r\n",
      "would be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to women, he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous\r\n",
      "folly, which he meant to be final, since marriage at some distant\r\n",
      "period would of course not be impetuous. For those who want to be\r\n",
      "acquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of\r\n",
      "impetuous folly, for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving\r\n",
      "of passion to which he was prone, together with the chivalrous kindness\r\n",
      "which helped to make him morally lovable. The story can be told without\r\n",
      "many words. It happened when he was studying in Paris, and just at the\r\n",
      "time when, over and above his other work, he was occupied with some\r\n",
      "galvanic experiments. One evening, tired with his experimenting, and\r\n",
      "not being able to elicit the facts he needed, he left his frogs and\r\n",
      "rabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation\r\n",
      "of unexplained shocks, and went to finish his evening at the theatre of\r\n",
      "the Porte Saint Martin, where there was a melodrama which he had\r\n",
      "already seen several times; attracted, not by the ingenious work of the\r\n",
      "collaborating authors, but by an actress whose part it was to stab her\r\n",
      "lover, mistaking him for the evil-designing duke of the piece. Lydgate\r\n",
      "was in love with this actress, as a man is in love with a woman whom he\r\n",
      "never expects to speak to. She was a Provencale, with dark eyes, a\r\n",
      "Greek profile, and rounded majestic form, having that sort of beauty\r\n",
      "which carries a sweet matronliness even in youth, and her voice was a\r\n",
      "soft cooing. She had but lately come to Paris, and bore a virtuous\r\n",
      "reputation, her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover. It\r\n",
      "was her acting which was “no better than it should be,” but the public\r\n",
      "was satisfied. Lydgate’s only relaxation now was to go and look at this\r\n",
      "woman, just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the\r\n",
      "sweet south on a bank of violets for a while, without prejudice to his\r\n",
      "galvanism, to which he would presently return. But this evening the old\r\n",
      "drama had a new catastrophe. At the moment when the heroine was to act\r\n",
      "the stabbing of her lover, and he was to fall gracefully, the wife\r\n",
      "veritably stabbed her husband, who fell as death willed. A wild shriek\r\n",
      "pierced the house, and the Provencale fell swooning: a shriek and a\r\n",
      "swoon were demanded by the play, but the swooning too was real this\r\n",
      "time. Lydgate leaped and climbed, he hardly knew how, on to the stage,\r\n",
      "and was active in help, making the acquaintance of his heroine by\r\n",
      "finding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms.\r\n",
      "Paris rang with the story of this death:—was it a murder? Some of the\r\n",
      "actress’s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt, and\r\n",
      "liked her the better for it (such was the taste of those times); but\r\n",
      "Lydgate was not one of these. He vehemently contended for her\r\n",
      "innocence, and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he\r\n",
      "had felt before, had passed now into personal devotion, and tender\r\n",
      "thought of her lot. The notion of murder was absurd: no motive was\r\n",
      "discoverable, the young couple being understood to dote on each other;\r\n",
      "and it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should\r\n",
      "have brought these grave consequences. The legal investigation ended in\r\n",
      "Madame Laure’s release. Lydgate by this time had had many interviews\r\n",
      "with her, and found her more and more adorable. She talked little; but\r\n",
      "that was an additional charm. She was melancholy, and seemed grateful;\r\n",
      "her presence was enough, like that of the evening light. Lydgate was\r\n",
      "madly anxious about her affection, and jealous lest any other man than\r\n",
      "himself should win it and ask her to marry him. But instead of\r\n",
      "reopening her engagement at the Porte Saint Martin, where she would\r\n",
      "have been all the more popular for the fatal episode, she left Paris\r\n",
      "without warning, forsaking her little court of admirers. Perhaps no one\r\n",
      "carried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that all science had come\r\n",
      "to a stand-still while he imagined the unhappy Laure, stricken by\r\n",
      "ever-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no faithful\r\n",
      "comforter. Hidden actresses, however, are not so difficult to find as\r\n",
      "some other hidden facts, and it was not long before Lydgate gathered\r\n",
      "indications that Laure had taken the route to Lyons. He found her at\r\n",
      "last acting with great success at Avignon under the same name, looking\r\n",
      "more majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her\r\n",
      "arms. He spoke to her after the play, was received with the usual\r\n",
      "quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water, and\r\n",
      "obtained leave to visit her the next day; when he was bent on telling\r\n",
      "her that he adored her, and on asking her to marry him. He knew that\r\n",
      "this was like the sudden impulse of a madman—incongruous even with his\r\n",
      "habitual foibles. No matter! It was the one thing which he was resolved\r\n",
      "to do. He had two selves within him apparently, and they must learn to\r\n",
      "accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments. Strange, that\r\n",
      "some of us, with quick alternate vision, see beyond our infatuations,\r\n",
      "and even while we rave on the heights, behold the wide plain where our\r\n",
      "persistent self pauses and awaits us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To have approached Laure with any suit that was not reverentially\r\n",
      "tender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling\r\n",
      "towards her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have come all the way from Paris to find me?” she said to him the\r\n",
      "next day, sitting before him with folded arms, and looking at him with\r\n",
      "eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders.\r\n",
      "“Are all Englishmen like that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I came because I could not live without trying to see you. You are\r\n",
      "lonely; I love you; I want you to consent to be my wife; I will wait,\r\n",
      "but I want you to promise that you will marry me—no one else.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under\r\n",
      "her grand eyelids, until he was full of rapturous certainty, and knelt\r\n",
      "close to her knees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will tell you something,” she said, in her cooing way, keeping her\r\n",
      "arms folded. “My foot really slipped.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know, I know,” said Lydgate, deprecatingly. “It was a fatal\r\n",
      "accident—a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again Laure paused a little and then said, slowly, “_I meant to do\r\n",

      "to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There was a secret, then,” he said at last, even vehemently. “He was\r\n",
      "brutal to you: you hated him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No! he wearied me; he was too fond: he would live in Paris, and not in\r\n",
      "my country; that was not agreeable to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Great God!” said Lydgate, in a groan of horror. “And you planned to\r\n",
      "murder him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not plan: it came to me in the play—_I meant to do it._”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "looked at her. He saw this woman—the first to whom he had given his\r\n",
      "young adoration—amid the throng of stupid criminals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Three days afterwards Lydgate was at his galvanism again in his Paris\r\n",

      "from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his\r\n",
      "belief that human life might be made better. But he had more reason\r\n",
      "than ever for trusting his judgment, now that it was so experienced;\r\n",

      "The question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain\r\n",
      "to the hospital was an exciting topic to the Middlemarchers; and\r\n",
      "Lydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power\r\n",
      "exercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode. The banker was evidently a\r\n",
      "ruler, but there was an opposition party, and even among his supporters\r\n",
      "there were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a\r\n",
      "compromise, and who frankly stated their impression that the general\r\n",
      "scheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you\r\n",
      "to hold a candle to the devil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode’s power was not due simply to his being a country banker,\r\n",
      "who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could\r\n",
      "touch the springs of their credit; it was fortified by a beneficence\r\n",
      "that was at once ready and severe—ready to confer obligations, and\r\n",
      "severe in watching the result. He had gathered, as an industrious man\r\n",
      "always at his post, a chief share in administering the town charities,\r\n",
      "and his private charities were both minute and abundant. He would take\r\n",
      "a great deal of pains about apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker’s son, and\r\n",
      "he would watch over Tegg’s church-going; he would defend Mrs. Strype\r\n",

      "drying-ground, and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against Mrs.\r\n",

      "strictly into the circumstances both before and after. In this way a\r\n",
      "man gathers a domain in his neighbors’ hope and fear as well as\r\n",
      "gratitude; and power, when once it has got into that subtle region,\r\n",
      "propagates itself, spreading out of all proportion to its external\r\n",
      "means. It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power as\r\n",
      "possible, that he might use it for the glory of God. He went through a\r\n",
      "great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust\r\n",
      "his motives, and make clear to himself what God’s glory required. But,\r\n",
      "as we have seen, his motives were not always rightly appreciated. There\r\n",
      "were many crass minds in Middlemarch whose reflective scales could only\r\n",
      "weigh things in the lump; and they had a strong suspicion that since\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion, eating and\r\n",
      "drinking so little as he did, and worreting himself about everything,\r\n",

      "turned entirely on his objection to Mr. Tyke’s sermons, which were all\r\n",
      "doctrine, and his preference for Mr. Farebrother, whose sermons were\r\n",
      "free from that taint. Mr. Vincy liked well enough the notion of the\r\n",

      "about this young man—for example, a certain showiness as to foreign\r\n",
      "ideas, and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and\r\n",
      "forgotten by his elders—was positively unwelcome to a physician whose\r\n",

      "talk about evidence as if it could really be weighed in scales by a\r\n",
      "blind Justice. No man can judge what is good evidence on any particular\r\n",
      "subject, unless he knows that subject well. A lawyer is no better than\r\n",
      "an old woman at a post-mortem examination. How is he to know the action\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was his\r\n",

      "good Middlemarch society: it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a\r\n",
      "qualification for any salaried office. Fred Vincy had called Lydgate a\r\n",
      "prig, and now Mr. Chichely was inclined to call him prick-eared;\r\n",
      "especially when, in the drawing-room, he seemed to be making himself\r\n",
      "eminently agreeable to Rosamond, whom he had easily monopolized in a\r\n",
      "_tête-à-tête_, since Mrs. Vincy herself sat at the tea-table. She\r\n",

      "blooming good-natured face, with the two volatile pink strings floating\r\n",
      "from her fine throat, and her cheery manners to husband and children,\r\n",
      "was certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy\r\n",
      "house—attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with the\r\n",
      "daughter. The tinge of unpretentious, inoffensive vulgarity in Mrs.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Certainly, small feet and perfectly turned shoulders aid the impression\r\n",
      "of refined manners, and the right thing said seems quite astonishingly\r\n",
      "right when it is accompanied with exquisite curves of lip and eyelid.\r\n",
      "And Rosamond could say the right thing; for she was clever with that\r\n",
      "sort of cleverness which catches every tone except the humorous.\r\n",

      "decisive mark of her cleverness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She and Lydgate readily got into conversation. He regretted that he had\r\n",
      "not heard her sing the other day at Stone Court. The only pleasure he\r\n",
      "allowed himself during the latter part of his stay in Paris was to go\r\n",
      "and hear music.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have studied music, probably?” said Rosamond.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I know the notes of many birds, and I know many melodies by ear;\r\n",
      "but the music that I don’t know at all, and have no notion about,\r\n",

      "more use of such a pleasure within its reach!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, and you will find Middlemarch very tuneless. There are hardly any\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose it is the fashion to sing comic songs in a rhythmic way,\r\n",

      "drum?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, you have heard Mr. Bowyer,” said Rosamond, with one of her rare\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate was almost forgetting that he must carry on the conversation,\r\n",
      "in thinking how lovely this creature was, her garment seeming to be\r\n",
      "made out of the faintest blue sky, herself so immaculately blond, as if\r\n",
      "the petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed her;\r\n",
      "and yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready,\r\n",
      "self-possessed grace. Since he had had the memory of Laure, Lydgate had\r\n",
      "lost all taste for large-eyed silence: the divine cow no longer\r\n",
      "attracted him, and Rosamond was her very opposite. But he recalled\r\n",
      "himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will let me hear some music to-night, I hope.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will let you hear my attempts, if you like,” said Rosamond. “Papa is\r\n",
      "sure to insist on my singing. But I shall tremble before you, who have\r\n",
      "heard the best singers in Paris. I have heard very little: I have only\r\n",
      "once been to London. But our organist at St. Peter’s is a good\r\n",
      "musician, and I go on studying with him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Very little.” (A more naive girl would have said, “Oh, everything!”\r\n",

      "country girls are always taken to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you call yourself a raw country girl?” said Lydgate, looking at her\r\n",
      "with an involuntary emphasis of admiration, which made Rosamond blush\r\n",
      "with pleasure. But she remained simply serious, turned her long neck a\r\n",
      "little, and put up her hand to touch her wondrous hair-plaits—an\r\n",
      "habitual gesture with her as pretty as any movements of a kitten’s paw.\r\n",
      "Not that Rosamond was in the least like a kitten: she was a sylph\r\n",
      "caught young and educated at Mrs. Lemon’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I assure you my mind is raw,” she said immediately; “I pass at\r\n",

      "knowledge is of a different sort. I am sure you could teach me a\r\n",
      "thousand things—as an exquisite bird could teach a bear if there were\r\n",
      "any common language between them. Happily, there is a common language\r\n",
      "between women and men, and so the bears can get taught.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, there is Fred beginning to strum! I must go and hinder him from\r\n",
      "jarring all your nerves,” said Rosamond, moving to the other side of\r\n",
      "the room, where Fred having opened the piano, at his father’s desire,\r\n",
      "that Rosamond might give them some music, was parenthetically\r\n",
      "performing “Cherry Ripe!” with one hand. Able men who have passed their\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Fred, pray defer your practising till to-morrow; you will make Mr.\r\n",

      "Fred laughed, and went on with his tune to the end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the bears will not always be taught.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now then, Rosy!” said Fred, springing from the stool and twisting it\r\n",
      "upward for her, with a hearty expectation of enjoyment. “Some good\r\n",
      "rousing tunes first.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond played admirably. Her master at Mrs. Lemon’s school (close to\r\n",
      "a county town with a memorable history that had its relics in church\r\n",
      "and castle) was one of those excellent musicians here and there to be\r\n",
      "found in our provinces, worthy to compare with many a noted\r\n",
      "Kapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful conditions of\r\n",
      "musical celebrity. Rosamond, with the executant’s instinct, had seized\r\n",
      "his manner of playing, and gave forth his large rendering of noble\r\n",
      "music with the precision of an echo. It was almost startling, heard for\r\n",
      "the first time. A hidden soul seemed to be flowing forth from\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s fingers; and so indeed it was, since souls live on in\r\n",
      "perpetual echoes, and to all fine expression there goes somewhere an\r\n",
      "originating activity, if it be only that of an interpreter. Lydgate was\r\n",
      "taken possession of, and began to believe in her as something\r\n",
      "exceptional. After all, he thought, one need not be surprised to find\r\n",
      "the rare conjunctions of nature under circumstances apparently\r\n",
      "unfavorable: come where they may, they always depend on conditions that\r\n",
      "are not obvious. He sat looking at her, and did not rise to pay her any\r\n",
      "compliments, leaving that to others, now that his admiration was\r\n",
      "deepened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her singing was less remarkable, but also well trained, and sweet to\r\n",
      "hear as a chime perfectly in tune. It is true she sang “Meet me by\r\n",
      "moonlight,” and “I’ve been roaming”; for mortals must share the\r\n",
      "fashions of their time, and none but the ancients can be always\r\n",
      "classical. But Rosamond could also sing “Black-eyed Susan” with effect,\r\n",
      "or Haydn’s canzonets, or “Voi, che sapete,” or “Batti, batti”—she only\r\n",
      "wanted to know what her audience liked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her father looked round at the company, delighting in their admiration.\r\n",
      "Her mother sat, like a Niobe before her troubles, with her youngest\r\n",
      "little girl on her lap, softly beating the child’s hand up and down in\r\n",
      "time to the music. And Fred, notwithstanding his general scepticism\r\n",
      "about Rosy, listened to her music with perfect allegiance, wishing he\r\n",
      "could do the same thing on his flute. It was the pleasantest family\r\n",
      "party that Lydgate had seen since he came to Middlemarch. The Vincys\r\n",
      "had the readiness to enjoy, the rejection of all anxiety, and the\r\n",
      "belief in life as a merry lot, which made a house exceptional in most\r\n",
      "county towns at that time, when Evangelicalism had cast a certain\r\n",
      "suspicion as of plague-infection over the few amusements which survived\r\n",
      "in the provinces. At the Vincys’ there was always whist, and the\r\n",
      "card-tables stood ready now, making some of the company secretly\r\n",
      "impatient of the music. Before it ceased Mr. Farebrother came in—a\r\n",
      "handsome, broad-chested but otherwise small man, about forty, whose\r\n",
      "black was very threadbare: the brilliancy was all in his quick gray\r\n",
      "eyes. He came like a pleasant change in the light, arresting little\r\n",
      "Louisa with fatherly nonsense as she was being led out of the room by\r\n",
      "Miss Morgan, greeting everybody with some special word, and seeming to\r\n",
      "condense more talk into ten minutes than had been held all through the\r\n",
      "evening. He claimed from Lydgate the fulfilment of a promise to come\r\n",
      "and see him. “I can’t let you off, you know, because I have some\r\n",
      "beetles to show you. We collectors feel an interest in every new man\r\n",
      "till he has seen all we have to show him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But soon he swerved to the whist-table, rubbing his hands and saying,\r\n",
      "“Come now, let us be serious! Mr. Lydgate? not play? Ah! you are too\r\n",
      "young and light for this kind of thing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate said to himself that the clergyman whose abilities were so\r\n",
      "painful to Mr. Bulstrode, appeared to have found an agreeable resort in\r\n",
      "this certainly not erudite household. He could half understand it: the\r\n",
      "good-humor, the good looks of elder and younger, and the provision for\r\n",
      "passing the time without any labor of intelligence, might make the\r\n",
      "house beguiling to people who had no particular use for their odd\r\n",
      "hours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who was\r\n",
      "brown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often said,\r\n",
      "just the sort of person for a governess. Lydgate did not mean to pay\r\n",
      "many such visits himself. They were a wretched waste of the evenings;\r\n",
      "and now, when he had talked a little more to Rosamond, he meant to\r\n",
      "excuse himself and go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will not like us at Middlemarch, I feel sure,” she said, when the\r\n",
      "whist-players were settled. “We are very stupid, and you have been used\r\n",
      "to something quite different.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose all country towns are pretty much alike,” said Lydgate. “But\r\n",
      "I have noticed that one always believes one’s own town to be more\r\n",
      "stupid than any other. I have made up my mind to take Middlemarch as it\r\n",
      "comes, and shall be much obliged if the town will take me in the same\r\n",
      "way. I have certainly found some charms in it which are much greater\r\n",
      "than I had expected.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You mean the rides towards Tipton and Lowick; every one is pleased\r\n",
      "with those,” said Rosamond, with simplicity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I mean something much nearer to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond rose and reached her netting, and then said, “Do you care\r\n",
      "about dancing at all? I am not quite sure whether clever men ever\r\n",
      "dance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I would dance with you if you would allow me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh!” said Rosamond, with a slight deprecatory laugh. “I was only going\r\n",
      "to say that we sometimes have dancing, and I wanted to know whether you\r\n",
      "would feel insulted if you were asked to come.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not on the condition I mentioned.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After this chat Lydgate thought that he was going, but on moving\r\n",
      "towards the whist-tables, he got interested in watching Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother’s play, which was masterly, and also his face, which was a\r\n",
      "striking mixture of the shrewd and the mild. At ten o’clock supper was\r\n",
      "brought in (such were the customs of Middlemarch) and there was\r\n",
      "punch-drinking; but Mr. Farebrother had only a glass of water. He was\r\n",
      "winning, but there seemed to be no reason why the renewal of rubbers\r\n",
      "should end, and Lydgate at last took his leave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But as it was not eleven o’clock, he chose to walk in the brisk air\r\n",
      "towards the tower of St. Botolph’s, Mr. Farebrother’s church, which\r\n",
      "stood out dark, square, and massive against the starlight. It was the\r\n",
      "oldest church in Middlemarch; the living, however, was but a vicarage\r\n",
      "worth barely four hundred a-year. Lydgate had heard that, and he\r\n",
      "wondered now whether Mr. Farebrother cared about the money he won at\r\n",
      "cards; thinking, “He seems a very pleasant fellow, but Bulstrode may\r\n",
      "have his good reasons.” Many things would be easier to Lydgate if it\r\n",
      "should turn out that Mr. Bulstrode was generally justifiable. “What is\r\n",
      "his religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along\r\n",
      "with it? One must use such brains as are to be found.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These were actually Lydgate’s first meditations as he walked away from\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy’s, and on this ground I fear that many ladies will consider\r\n",
      "him hardly worthy of their attention. He thought of Rosamond and her\r\n",
      "music only in the second place; and though, when her turn came, he\r\n",
      "dwelt on the image of her for the rest of his walk, he felt no\r\n",
      "agitation, and had no sense that any new current had set into his life.\r\n",
      "He could not marry yet; he wished not to marry for several years; and\r\n",
      "therefore he was not ready to entertain the notion of being in love\r\n",
      "with a girl whom he happened to admire. He did admire Rosamond\r\n",
      "exceedingly; but that madness which had once beset him about Laure was\r\n",
      "not, he thought, likely to recur in relation to any other woman.\r\n",
      "Certainly, if falling in love had been at all in question, it would\r\n",
      "have been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just\r\n",
      "the kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman—polished, refined,\r\n",
      "docile, lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of life, and\r\n",
      "enshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of demonstration\r\n",
      "that excluded the need for other evidence. Lydgate felt sure that if\r\n",
      "ever he married, his wife would have that feminine radiance, that\r\n",
      "distinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers and music,\r\n",
      "that sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous, being\r\n",
      "moulded only for pure and delicate joys.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But since he did not mean to marry for the next five years—his more\r\n",
      "pressing business was to look into Louis’ new book on Fever, which he\r\n",
      "was specially interested in, because he had known Louis in Paris, and\r\n",

      "specific differences of typhus and typhoid. He went home and read far\r\n",
      "into the smallest hour, bringing a much more testing vision of details\r\n",
      "and relations into this pathological study than he had ever thought it\r\n",
      "necessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage, these\r\n",

      "that delightful labor of the imagination which is not mere\r\n",
      "arbitrariness, but the exercise of disciplined power—combining and\r\n",
      "constructing with the clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest\r\n",
      "obedience to knowledge; and then, in yet more energetic alliance with\r\n",

      "regarded as rather vulgar and vinous compared with the imagination that\r\n",
      "reveals subtle actions inaccessible by any sort of lens, but tracked in\r\n",

      "inward light which is the last refinement of Energy, capable of bathing\r\n",

      "reason for throwing her marriage into distant perspective, nor any\r\n",
      "pathological studies to divert her mind from that ruminating habit,\r\n",
      "that inward repetition of looks, words, and phrases, which makes a\r\n",

      "at her possession of such accomplishment. But Rosamond had registered\r\n",
      "every look and word, and estimated them as the opening incidents of a\r\n",
      "preconceived romance—incidents which gather value from the foreseen\r\n",
      "development and climax. In Rosamond’s romance it was not necessary to\r\n",
      "imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his serious\r\n",
      "business in the world: of course, he had a profession and was clever,\r\n",

      "was his good birth, which distinguished him from all Middlemarch\r\n",

      "getting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which\r\n",
      "she would have nothing to do with vulgar people, and perhaps at last\r\n",
      "associate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked\r\n",
      "down on the Middlemarchers. It was part of Rosamond’s cleverness to\r\n",

      "of comparison a little more effectively, and consider whether red cloth\r\n",
      "and epaulets have never had an influence of that sort. Our passions do\r\n",
      "not live apart in locked chambers, but, dressed in their small wardrobe\r\n",

      "The Rev. Camden Farebrother, whom Lydgate went to see the next evening,\r\n",
      "lived in an old parsonage, built of stone, venerable enough to match\r\n",
      "the church which it looked out upon. All the furniture too in the house\r\n",
      "was old, but with another grade of age—that of Mr. Farebrother’s father\r\n",
      "and grandfather. There were painted white chairs, with gilding and\r\n",
      "wreaths on them, and some lingering red silk damask with slits in it.\r\n",
      "There were engraved portraits of Lord Chancellors and other celebrated\r\n",
      "lawyers of the last century; and there were old pier-glasses to reflect\r\n",
      "them, as well as the little satin-wood tables and the sofas resembling\r\n",
      "a prolongation of uneasy chairs, all standing in relief against the\r\n",
      "dark wainscot. This was the physiognomy of the drawing-room into which\r\n",
      "Lydgate was shown; and there were three ladies to receive him, who were\r\n",
      "also old-fashioned, and of a faded but genuine respectability: Mrs.\r\n",
      "Farebrother, the Vicar’s white-haired mother, befrilled and kerchiefed\r\n",
      "with dainty cleanliness, upright, quick-eyed, and still under seventy;\r\n",
      "Miss Noble, her sister, a tiny old lady of meeker aspect, with frills\r\n",
      "and kerchief decidedly more worn and mended; and Miss Winifred\r\n",
      "Farebrother, the Vicar’s elder sister, well-looking like himself, but\r\n",
      "nipped and subdued as single women are apt to be who spend their lives\r\n",
      "in uninterrupted subjection to their elders. Lydgate had not expected\r\n",
      "to see so quaint a group: knowing simply that Mr. Farebrother was a\r\n",
      "bachelor, he had thought of being ushered into a snuggery where the\r\n",
      "chief furniture would probably be books and collections of natural\r\n",
      "objects. The Vicar himself seemed to wear rather a changed aspect, as\r\n",
      "most men do when acquaintances made elsewhere see them for the first\r\n",
      "time in their own homes; some indeed showing like an actor of genial\r\n",
      "parts disadvantageously cast for the curmudgeon in a new piece. This\r\n",
      "was not the case with Mr. Farebrother: he seemed a trifle milder and\r\n",
      "more silent, the chief talker being his mother, while he only put in a\r\n",
      "good-humored moderating remark here and there. The old lady was\r\n",
      "evidently accustomed to tell her company what they ought to think, and\r\n",
      "to regard no subject as quite safe without her steering. She was\r\n",
      "afforded leisure for this function by having all her little wants\r\n",
      "attended to by Miss Winifred. Meanwhile tiny Miss Noble carried on her\r\n",
      "arm a small basket, into which she diverted a bit of sugar, which she\r\n",
      "had first dropped in her saucer as if by mistake; looking round\r\n",
      "furtively afterwards, and reverting to her teacup with a small innocent\r\n",
      "noise as of a tiny timid quadruped. Pray think no ill of Miss Noble.\r\n",
      "That basket held small savings from her more portable food, destined\r\n",
      "for the children of her poor friends among whom she trotted on fine\r\n",
      "mornings; fostering and petting all needy creatures being so\r\n",
      "spontaneous a delight to her, that she regarded it much as if it had\r\n",
      "been a pleasant vice that she was addicted to. Perhaps she was\r\n",
      "conscious of being tempted to steal from those who had much that she\r\n",
      "might give to those who had nothing, and carried in her conscience the\r\n",
      "guilt of that repressed desire. One must be poor to know the luxury of\r\n",
      "giving!\r\n",

      "Mrs. Farebrother welcomed the guest with a lively formality and\r\n",
      "precision. She presently informed him that they were not often in want\r\n",
      "of medical aid in that house. She had brought up her children to wear\r\n",
      "flannel and not to over-eat themselves, which last habit she considered\r\n",
      "the chief reason why people needed doctors. Lydgate pleaded for those\r\n",
      "whose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves, but Mrs.\r\n",
      "Farebrother held that view of things dangerous: Nature was more just\r\n",
      "than that; it would be easy for any felon to say that his ancestors\r\n",
      "ought to have been hanged instead of him. If those who had bad fathers\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "“Excuse me there. If you go upon arguments, they are never wanting,\r\n",
      "when a man has no constancy of mind. My father never changed, and he\r\n",
      "preached plain moral sermons without arguments, and was a good man—few\r\n",
      "better. When you get me a good man made out of arguments, I will get\r\n",

      "lights, though there are plenty of them here as elsewhere. I say, they\r\n",
      "came in with the mixed stuffs that will neither wash nor wear. It was\r\n",
      "not so in my youth: a Churchman was a Churchman, and a clergyman, you\r\n",
      "might be pretty sure, was a gentleman, if nothing else. But now he may\r\n",
      "be no better than a Dissenter, and want to push aside my son on\r\n",
      "pretence of doctrine. But whoever may wish to push him aside, I am\r\n",
      "proud to say, Mr. Lydgate, that he will compare with any preacher in\r\n",
      "this kingdom, not to speak of this town, which is but a low standard to\r\n",
      "go by; at least, to my thinking, for I was born and bred at Exeter.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, poor creature! what indeed?” said Mrs. Farebrother, her sharpness\r\n",
      "blunted for the moment by her confidence in maternal judgments. “She\r\n",
      "says the truth to herself, depend upon it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what is the truth?” said Lydgate. “I am curious to know.”\r\n",

      "agree with him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, Camden!” said Miss Winifred, “Griffin and his wife told me only\r\n",

      "to hear you preach.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Farebrother laid down her knitting, which she had resumed after\r\n",
      "her small allowance of tea and toast, and looked at her son as if to\r\n",
      "say “You hear that?” Miss Noble said, “Oh poor things! poor things!” in\r\n",
      "reference, probably, to the double loss of preaching and coal. But the\r\n",
      "Vicar answered quietly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is because they are not my parishioners. And I don’t think my\r\n",

      "“Mr. Lydgate,” said Mrs. Farebrother, who could not let this pass, “you\r\n",
      "don’t know my son: he always undervalues himself. I tell him he is\r\n",
      "undervaluing the God who made him, and made him a most excellent\r\n",
      "preacher.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That must be a hint for me to take Mr. Lydgate away to my study,\r\n",

      "collection,” he added, turning to Lydgate; “shall we go?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All three ladies remonstrated. Mr. Lydgate ought not to be hurried away\r\n",
      "without being allowed to accept another cup of tea: Miss Winifred had\r\n",
      "abundance of good tea in the pot. Why was Camden in such haste to take\r\n",
      "a visitor to his den? There was nothing but pickled vermin, and drawers\r\n",
      "full of blue-bottles and moths, with no carpet on the floor. Mr.\r\n",
      "Lydgate must excuse it. A game at cribbage would be far better. In\r\n",
      "short, it was plain that a vicar might be adored by his womankind as\r\n",
      "the king of men and preachers, and yet be held by them to stand in much\r\n",
      "need of their direction. Lydgate, with the usual shallowness of a young\r\n",
      "bachelor, wondered that Mr. Farebrother had not taught them better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My mother is not used to my having visitors who can take any interest\r\n",
      "in my hobbies,” said the Vicar, as he opened the door of his study,\r\n",
      "which was indeed as bare of luxuries for the body as the ladies had\r\n",
      "implied, unless a short porcelain pipe and a tobacco-box were to be\r\n",
      "excepted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Men of your profession don’t generally smoke,” he said. Lydgate smiled\r\n",
      "and shook his head. “Nor of mine either, properly, I suppose. You will\r\n",
      "hear that pipe alleged against me by Bulstrode and Company. They don’t\r\n",
      "know how pleased the devil would be if I gave it up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I understand. You are of an excitable temper and want a sedative. I am\r\n",
      "heavier, and should get idle with it. I should rush into idleness, and\r\n",
      "stagnate there with all my might.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you mean to give it all to your work. I am some ten or twelve\r\n",
      "years older than you, and have come to a compromise. I feed a weakness\r\n",
      "or two lest they should get clamorous. See,” continued the Vicar,\r\n",
      "opening several small drawers, “I fancy I have made an exhaustive study\r\n",
      "of the entomology of this district. I am going on both with the fauna\r\n",
      "and flora; but I have at least done my insects well. We are singularly\r\n",
      "rich in orthoptera: I don’t know whether—Ah! you have got hold of that\r\n",
      "glass jar—you are looking into that instead of my drawers. You don’t\r\n",
      "really care about these things?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster. I have never had\r\n",
      "time to give myself much to natural history. I was early bitten with an\r\n",
      "interest in structure, and it is what lies most directly in my\r\n",
      "profession. I have no hobby besides. I have the sea to swim in there.”\r\n",

      "uncomfortable than to make them better. Their system is a sort of\r\n",
      "worldly-spiritual cliqueism: they really look on the rest of mankind as\r\n",

      "an unusual delicacy and generosity, which Lydgate’s nature was keenly\r\n",
      "alive to. It went along with other points of conduct in Mr. Farebrother\r\n",
      "which were exceptionally fine, and made his character resemble those\r\n",
      "southern landscapes which seem divided between natural grandeur and\r\n",
      "social slovenliness. Very few men could have been as filial and\r\n",
      "chivalrous as he was to the mother, aunt, and sister, whose dependence\r\n",
      "on him had in many ways shaped his life rather uneasily for himself;\r\n",
      "few men who feel the pressure of small needs are so nobly resolute not\r\n",
      "to dress up their inevitably self-interested desires in a pretext of\r\n",
      "better motives. In these matters he was conscious that his life would\r\n",
      "bear the closest scrutiny; and perhaps the consciousness encouraged a\r\n",
      "little defiance towards the critical strictness of persons whose\r\n",
      "celestial intimacies seemed not to improve their domestic manners, and\r\n",
      "whose lofty aims were not needed to account for their actions. Then,\r\n",
      "his preaching was ingenious and pithy, like the preaching of the\r\n",
      "English Church in its robust age, and his sermons were delivered\r\n",
      "without book. People outside his parish went to hear him; and, since to\r\n",
      "fill the church was always the most difficult part of a clergyman’s\r\n",
      "function, here was another ground for a careless sense of superiority.\r\n",

      "without grins of suppressed bitterness or other conversational flavors\r\n",
      "which make half of us an affliction to our friends. Lydgate liked him\r\n",
      "heartily, and wished for his friendship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this feeling uppermost, he continued to waive the question of the\r\n",
      "chaplaincy, and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper\r\n",
      "business of his, but likely enough never to vex him with a demand for\r\n",
      "his vote. Lydgate, at Mr. Bulstrode’s request, was laying down plans\r\n",
      "for the internal arrangements of the new hospital, and the two were\r\n",
      "often in consultation. The banker was always presupposing that he could\r\n",
      "count in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor, but made no special\r\n",
      "recurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother. When\r\n",
      "the General Board of the Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had\r\n",
      "notice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of\r\n",
      "the directors and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he had\r\n",
      "a vexed sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch\r\n",
      "business. He could not help hearing within him the distinct declaration\r\n",
      "that Bulstrode was prime minister, and that the Tyke affair was a\r\n",
      "question of office or no office; and he could not help an equally\r\n",
      "pronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office. For his\r\n",
      "observation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother’s assurance that\r\n",
      "the banker would not overlook opposition. “Confound their petty\r\n",
      "politics!” was one of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative\r\n",
      "process of shaving, when he had begun to feel that he must really hold\r\n",
      "a court of conscience on this matter. Certainly there were valid things\r\n",
      "to be said against the election of Mr. Farebrother: he had too much on\r\n",
      "his hands already, especially considering how much time he spent on\r\n",
      "non-clerical occupations. Then again it was a continually repeated\r\n",
      "shock, disturbing Lydgate’s esteem, that the Vicar should obviously\r\n",
      "play for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but evidently\r\n",
      "liking some end which it served. Mr. Farebrother contended on theory\r\n",
      "for the desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen’s wit was\r\n",
      "stagnant for want of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he would have\r\n",
      "played very much less but for the money. There was a billiard-room at\r\n",
      "the Green Dragon, which some anxious mothers and wives regarded as the\r\n",
      "chief temptation in Middlemarch. The Vicar was a first-rate\r\n",
      "billiard-player, and though he did not frequent the Green Dragon, there\r\n",
      "were reports that he had sometimes been there in the daytime and had\r\n",
      "won money. And as to the chaplaincy, he did not pretend that he cared\r\n",
      "for it, except for the sake of the forty pounds. Lydgate was no\r\n",
      "Puritan, but he did not care for play, and winning money at it had\r\n",
      "always seemed a meanness to him; besides, he had an ideal of life which\r\n",
      "made this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small sums\r\n",
      "thoroughly hateful to him. Hitherto in his own life his wants had been\r\n",
      "supplied without any trouble to himself, and his first impulse was\r\n",
      "always to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a\r\n",
      "gentleman; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting\r\n",
      "half-crowns. He had always known in a general way that he was not rich,\r\n",
      "but he had never felt poor, and he had no power of imagining the part\r\n",
      "which the want of money plays in determining the actions of men. Money\r\n",
      "had never been a motive to him. Hence he was not ready to frame excuses\r\n",
      "for this deliberate pursuit of small gains. It was altogether repulsive\r\n",
      "to him, and he never entered into any calculation of the ratio between\r\n",
      "the Vicar’s income and his more or less necessary expenditure. It was\r\n",
      "possible that he would not have made such a calculation in his own\r\n",
      "case.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, when the question of voting had come, this repulsive fact told\r\n",
      "more strongly against Mr. Farebrother than it had done before. One\r\n",
      "would know much better what to do if men’s characters were more\r\n",
      "consistent, and especially if one’s friends were invariably fit for any\r\n",
      "function they desired to undertake! Lydgate was convinced that if there\r\n",
      "had been no valid objection to Mr. Farebrother, he would have voted for\r\n",
      "him, whatever Bulstrode might have felt on the subject: he did not\r\n",
      "intend to be a vassal of Bulstrode’s. On the other hand, there was\r\n",
      "Tyke, a man entirely given to his clerical office, who was simply\r\n",
      "curate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter’s parish, and had time for\r\n",
      "extra duty. Nobody had anything to say against Mr. Tyke, except that\r\n",
      "they could not bear him, and suspected him of cant. Really, from his\r\n",
      "point of view, Bulstrode was thoroughly justified.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But whichever way Lydgate began to incline, there was something to make\r\n",
      "him wince; and being a proud man, he was a little exasperated at being\r\n",
      "obliged to wince. He did not like frustrating his own best purposes by\r\n",
      "getting on bad terms with Bulstrode; he did not like voting against\r\n",
      "Farebrother, and helping to deprive him of function and salary; and the\r\n",
      "question occurred whether the additional forty pounds might not leave\r\n",
      "the Vicar free from that ignoble care about winning at cards. Moreover,\r\n",
      "Lydgate did not like the consciousness that in voting for Tyke he\r\n",
      "should be voting on the side obviously convenient for himself. But\r\n",
      "would the end really be his own convenience? Other people would say so,\r\n",
      "and would allege that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for the sake\r\n",
      "of making himself important and getting on in the world. What then? He\r\n",
      "for his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had been\r\n",
      "concerned, he would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker’s\r\n",
      "friendship or enmity. What he really cared for was a medium for his\r\n",
      "work, a vehicle for his ideas; and after all, was he not bound to\r\n",
      "prefer the object of getting a good hospital, where he could\r\n",
      "demonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic\r\n",
      "results, before anything else connected with this chaplaincy? For the\r\n",
      "first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of\r\n",
      "small social conditions, and their frustrating complexity. At the end\r\n",
      "of his inward debate, when he set out for the hospital, his hope was\r\n",
      "really in the chance that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to\r\n",
      "the question, and make the scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for\r\n",
      "voting. I think he trusted a little also to the energy which is\r\n",
      "begotten by circumstances—some feeling rushing warmly and making\r\n",
      "resolve easy, while debate in cool blood had only made it more\r\n",
      "difficult. However it was, he did not distinctly say to himself on\r\n",
      "which side he would vote; and all the while he was inwardly resenting\r\n",
      "the subjection which had been forced upon him. It would have seemed\r\n",
      "beforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he, with his\r\n",
      "unmixed resolutions of independence and his select purposes, would find\r\n",

      "Lydgate was late in setting out, but Dr. Sprague, the two other\r\n",
      "surgeons, and several of the directors had arrived early; Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, treasurer and chairman, being among those who were still\r\n",
      "absent. The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was\r\n",
      "problematical, and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as had\r\n",
      "been generally supposed. The two physicians, for a wonder, turned out\r\n",
      "to be unanimous, or rather, though of different minds, they concurred\r\n",
      "in action. Dr. Sprague, the rugged and weighty, was, as every one had\r\n",
      "foreseen, an adherent of Mr. Farebrother. The Doctor was more than\r\n",
      "suspected of having no religion, but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this\r\n",
      "deficiency in him as if he had been a Lord Chancellor; indeed it is\r\n",
      "probable that his professional weight was the more believed in, the\r\n",
      "world-old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still\r\n",
      "potent in the minds even of lady-patients who had the strictest ideas\r\n",
      "of frilling and sentiment. It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor\r\n",
      "which made his neighbors call him hard-headed and dry-witted;\r\n",
      "conditions of texture which were also held favorable to the storing of\r\n",
      "judgments connected with drugs. At all events, it is certain that if\r\n",
      "any medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having\r\n",
      "very definite religious views, of being given to prayer, and of\r\n",
      "otherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general\r\n",
      "presumption against his medical skill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On this ground it was (professionally speaking) fortunate for Dr.\r\n",
      "Minchin that his religious sympathies were of a general kind, and such\r\n",
      "as gave a distant medical sanction to all serious sentiment, whether of\r\n",
      "Church or Dissent, rather than any adhesion to particular tenets. If\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode insisted, as he was apt to do, on the Lutheran doctrine\r\n",
      "of justification, as that by which a Church must stand or fall, Dr.\r\n",
      "Minchin in return was quite sure that man was not a mere machine or a\r\n",
      "fortuitous conjunction of atoms; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a\r\n",
      "particular providence in relation to her stomach complaint, Dr. Minchin\r\n",
      "for his part liked to keep the mental windows open and objected to\r\n",
      "fixed limits; if the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian\r\n",
      "Creed, Dr. Minchin quoted Pope’s “Essay on Man.” He objected to the\r\n",
      "rather free style of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged, preferring\r\n",
      "well-sanctioned quotations, and liking refinement of all kinds: it was\r\n",
      "generally known that he had some kinship to a bishop, and sometimes\r\n",
      "spent his holidays at “the palace.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dr. Minchin was soft-handed, pale-complexioned, and of rounded outline,\r\n",
      "not to be distinguished from a mild clergyman in appearance: whereas\r\n",
      "Dr. Sprague was superfluously tall; his trousers got creased at the\r\n",
      "knees, and showed an excess of boot at a time when straps seemed\r\n",
      "necessary to any dignity of bearing; you heard him go in and out, and\r\n",
      "up and down, as if he had come to see after the roofing. In short, he\r\n",
      "had weight, and might be expected to grapple with a disease and throw\r\n",
      "it; while Dr. Minchin might be better able to detect it lurking and to\r\n",
      "circumvent it. They enjoyed about equally the mysterious privilege of\r\n",
      "medical reputation, and concealed with much etiquette their contempt\r\n",
      "for each other’s skill. Regarding themselves as Middlemarch\r\n",
      "institutions, they were ready to combine against all innovators, and\r\n",
      "against non-professionals given to interference. On this ground they\r\n",
      "were both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode, though Dr.\r\n",
      "Minchin had never been in open hostility with him, and never differed\r\n",
      "from him without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode, who had found\r\n",
      "that Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution. A layman who pried\r\n",
      "into the professional conduct of medical men, and was always obtruding\r\n",
      "his reforms,—though he was less directly embarrassing to the two\r\n",
      "physicians than to the surgeon-apothecaries who attended paupers by\r\n",
      "contract, was nevertheless offensive to the professional nostril as\r\n",
      "such; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the new pique against Bulstrode,\r\n",
      "excited by his apparent determination to patronize Lydgate. The\r\n",
      "long-established practitioners, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Toller; were just\r\n",
      "now standing apart and having a friendly colloquy, in which they agreed\r\n",
      "that Lydgate was a jackanapes, just made to serve Bulstrode’s purpose.\r\n",
      "To non-medical friends they had already concurred in praising the other\r\n",
      "young practitioner, who had come into the town on Mr. Peacock’s\r\n",
      "retirement without further recommendation than his own merits and such\r\n",
      "argument for solid professional acquirement as might be gathered from\r\n",
      "his having apparently wasted no time on other branches of knowledge. It\r\n",
      "was clear that Lydgate, by not dispensing drugs, intended to cast\r\n",
      "imputations on his equals, and also to obscure the limit between his\r\n",
      "own rank as a general practitioner and that of the physicians, who, in\r\n",
      "the interest of the profession, felt bound to maintain its various\r\n",
      "grades,—especially against a man who had not been to either of the\r\n",
      "English universities and enjoyed the absence of anatomical and bedside\r\n",
      "study there, but came with a libellous pretension to experience in\r\n",
      "Edinburgh and Paris, where observation might be abundant indeed, but\r\n",
      "hardly sound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus it happened that on this occasion Bulstrode became identified with\r\n",
      "Lydgate, and Lydgate with Tyke; and owing to this variety of\r\n",
      "interchangeable names for the chaplaincy question, diverse minds were\r\n",
      "enabled to form the same judgment concerning it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dr. Sprague said at once bluntly to the group assembled when he\r\n",
      "entered, “I go for Farebrother. A salary, with all my heart. But why\r\n",
      "take it from the Vicar? He has none too much—has to insure his life,\r\n",
      "besides keeping house, and doing a vicar’s charities. Put forty pounds\r\n",
      "in his pocket and you’ll do no harm. He’s a good fellow, is\r\n",
      "Farebrother, with as little of the parson about him as will serve to\r\n",
      "carry orders.”\r\n",

      "Parliamentary disapproval; “we must let you have your say. But what we\r\n",
      "have to consider is not anybody’s income—it’s the souls of the poor\r\n",
      "sick people”—here Mr. Powderell’s voice and face had a sincere pathos\r\n",
      "in them. “He is a real Gospel preacher, is Mr. Tyke. I should vote\r\n",

      "some severity towards innocent Mr. Powderell. “But in my judgment it\r\n",
      "behoves us, as Directors, to consider whether we will regard it as our\r\n",
      "whole business to carry out propositions emanating from a single\r\n",
      "quarter. Will any member of the committee aver that he would have\r\n",
      "entertained the idea of displacing the gentleman who has always\r\n",
      "discharged the function of chaplain here, if it had not been suggested\r\n",
      "to him by parties whose disposition it is to regard every institution\r\n",
      "of this town as a machinery for carrying out their own views? I tax no\r\n",
      "man’s motives: let them lie between himself and a higher Power; but I\r\n",
      "do say, that there are influences at work here which are incompatible\r\n",
      "with genuine independence, and that a crawling servility is usually\r\n",
      "dictated by circumstances which gentlemen so conducting themselves\r\n",
      "could not afford either morally or financially to avow. I myself am a\r\n",
      "layman, but I have given no inconsiderable attention to the divisions\r\n",
      "in the Church and—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "town-clerk, who rarely presented himself at the board, but now looked\r\n",
      "in hurriedly, whip in hand. “We have nothing to do with them here.\r\n",
      "Farebrother has been doing the work—what there was—without pay, and if\r\n",
      "pay is to be given, it should be given to him. I call it a confounded\r\n",

      "repeat, or even to conclude what I was about to say—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, here’s Minchin!” said Mr. Frank Hawley; at which everybody turned\r\n",
      "away from Mr. Hackbutt, leaving him to feel the uselessness of superior\r\n",
      "gifts in Middlemarch. “Come, Doctor, I must have you on the right side,\r\n",
      "eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "there; “at whatever cost to my feelings.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If there’s any feeling here, it should be feeling for the man who is\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I confess I have feelings on the other side also. I have a divided\r\n",
      "esteem,” said Dr. Minchin, rubbing his hands. “I consider Mr. Tyke an\r\n",
      "exemplary man—none more so—and I believe him to be proposed from\r\n",
      "unimpeachable motives. I, for my part, wish that I could give him my\r\n",
      "vote. But I am constrained to take a view of the case which gives the\r\n",
      "preponderance to Mr. Farebrother’s claims. He is an amiable man, an\r\n",
      "able preacher, and has been longer among us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Old Mr. Powderell looked on, sad and silent. Mr. Plymdale settled his\r\n",

      "be, I hope,” said Mr. Larcher, the eminent carrier, who had just come\r\n",
      "in. “I have no ill-will towards him, but I think we owe something to\r\n",
      "the public, not to speak of anything higher, in these appointments. In\r\n",
      "my opinion Farebrother is too lax for a clergyman. I don’t wish to\r\n",
      "bring up particulars against him; but he will make a little attendance\r\n",
      "here go as far as he can.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And a devilish deal better than too much,” said Mr. Hawley, whose bad\r\n",
      "language was notorious in that part of the county. “Sick people can’t\r\n",
      "bear so much praying and preaching. And that methodistical sort of\r\n",

      "turning quickly round to the four medical men who were assembled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But any answer was dispensed with by the entrance of three gentlemen,\r\n",
      "with whom there were greetings more or less cordial. These were the\r\n",
      "Reverend Edward Thesiger, Rector of St. Peter’s, Mr. Bulstrode, and our\r\n",
      "friend Mr. Brooke of Tipton, who had lately allowed himself to be put\r\n",
      "on the board of directors in his turn, but had never before attended,\r\n",
      "his attendance now being due to Mr. Bulstrode’s exertions. Lydgate was\r\n",
      "the only person still expected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every one now sat down, Mr. Bulstrode presiding, pale and\r\n",
      "self-restrained as usual. Mr. Thesiger, a moderate evangelical, wished\r\n",
      "for the appointment of his friend Mr. Tyke, a zealous able man, who,\r\n",
      "officiating at a chapel of ease, had not a cure of souls too extensive\r\n",
      "to leave him ample time for the new duty. It was desirable that\r\n",
      "chaplaincies of this kind should be entered on with a fervent\r\n",
      "intention: they were peculiar opportunities for spiritual influence;\r\n",
      "and while it was good that a salary should be allotted, there was the\r\n",
      "more need for scrupulous watching lest the office should be perverted\r\n",
      "into a mere question of salary. Mr. Thesiger’s manner had so much quiet\r\n",
      "propriety that objectors could only simmer in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke believed that everybody meant well in the matter. He had not\r\n",
      "himself attended to the affairs of the Infirmary, though he had a\r\n",
      "strong interest in whatever was for the benefit of Middlemarch, and was\r\n",
      "most happy to meet the gentlemen present on any public question—“any\r\n",
      "public question, you know,” Mr. Brooke repeated, with his nod of\r\n",
      "perfect understanding. “I am a good deal occupied as a magistrate, and\r\n",
      "in the collection of documentary evidence, but I regard my time as\r\n",
      "being at the disposal of the public—and, in short, my friends have\r\n",
      "convinced me that a chaplain with a salary—a salary, you know—is a very\r\n",
      "good thing, and I am happy to be able to come here and vote for the\r\n",
      "appointment of Mr. Tyke, who, I understand, is an unexceptionable man,\r\n",
      "apostolic and eloquent and everything of that kind—and I am the last\r\n",
      "man to withhold my vote—under the circumstances, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It seems to me that you have been crammed with one side of the\r\n",
      "question, Mr. Brooke,” said Mr. Frank Hawley, who was afraid of nobody,\r\n",
      "and was a Tory suspicious of electioneering intentions. “You don’t seem\r\n",
      "to know that one of the worthiest men we have has been doing duty as\r\n",
      "chaplain here for years without pay, and that Mr. Tyke is proposed to\r\n",
      "supersede him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me, Mr. Hawley,” said Mr. Bulstrode. “Mr. Brooke has been fully\r\n",
      "informed of Mr. Farebrother’s character and position.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By his enemies,” flashed out Mr. Hawley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I trust there is no personal hostility concerned here,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Thesiger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll swear there is, though,” retorted Mr. Hawley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Bulstrode, in a subdued tone, “the merits of the\r\n",
      "question may be very briefly stated, and if any one present doubts that\r\n",
      "every gentleman who is about to give his vote has not been fully\r\n",
      "informed, I can now recapitulate the considerations that should weigh\r\n",
      "on either side.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t see the good of that,” said Mr. Hawley. “I suppose we all know\r\n",
      "whom we mean to vote for. Any man who wants to do justice does not wait\r\n",
      "till the last minute to hear both sides of the question. I have no time\r\n",
      "to lose, and I propose that the matter be put to the vote at once.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A brief but still hot discussion followed before each person wrote\r\n",
      "“Tyke” or “Farebrother” on a piece of paper and slipped it into a glass\r\n",
      "tumbler; and in the mean time Mr. Bulstrode saw Lydgate enter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I perceive that the votes are equally divided at present,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, in a clear biting voice. Then, looking up at Lydgate—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is a casting-vote still to be given. It is yours, Mr. Lydgate:\r\n",
      "will you be good enough to write?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The thing is settled now,” said Mr. Wrench, rising. “We all know how\r\n",
      "Mr. Lydgate will vote.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning, sir,” said Lydgate,\r\n",
      "rather defiantly, and keeping his pencil suspended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I merely mean that you are expected to vote with Mr. Bulstrode. Do you\r\n",
      "regard that meaning as offensive?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It may be offensive to others. But I shall not desist from voting with\r\n",
      "him on that account.” Lydgate immediately wrote down “Tyke.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So the Rev. Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary, and Lydgate\r\n",
      "continued to work with Mr. Bulstrode. He was really uncertain whether\r\n",
      "Tyke were not the more suitable candidate, and yet his consciousness\r\n",
      "told him that if he had been quite free from indirect bias he should\r\n",
      "have voted for Mr. Farebrother. The affair of the chaplaincy remained a\r\n",
      "sore point in his memory as a case in which this petty medium of\r\n",
      "Middlemarch had been too strong for him. How could a man be satisfied\r\n",
      "with a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances?\r\n",
      "No more than he can be satisfied with his hat, which he has chosen from\r\n",
      "among such shapes as the resources of the age offer him, wearing it at\r\n",
      "best with a resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mr. Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before. The\r\n",
      "character of the publican and sinner is not always practically\r\n",
      "incompatible with that of the modern Pharisee, for the majority of us\r\n",
      "scarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the\r\n",
      "faultiness of our own arguments, or the dulness of our own jokes. But\r\n",
      "the Vicar of St. Botolph’s had certainly escaped the slightest tincture\r\n",
      "of the Pharisee, and by dint of admitting to himself that he was too\r\n",
      "much as other men were, he had become remarkably unlike them in\r\n",
      "this—that he could excuse others for thinking slightly of him, and\r\n",
      "could judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The world has been too strong for _me_, I know,” he said one day to\r\n",
      "Lydgate. “But then I am not a mighty man—I shall never be a man of\r\n",
      "renown. The choice of Hercules is a pretty fable; but Prodicus makes it\r\n",
      "easy work for the hero, as if the first resolves were enough. Another\r\n",
      "story says that he came to hold the distaff, and at last wore the\r\n",

      "acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few\r\n",
      "imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of\r\n",
      "married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than\r\n",
      "what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether\r\n",
      "the same. And it would be astonishing to find how soon the change is\r\n",
      "felt if we had no kindred changes to compare with it. To share lodgings\r\n",
      "with a brilliant dinner-companion, or to see your favorite politician\r\n",
      "in the Ministry, may bring about changes quite as rapid: in these cases\r\n",

      "any ruminant animal, and he had not actively assisted in creating any\r\n",
      "illusions about himself. How was it that in the weeks since her\r\n",
      "marriage, Dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling\r\n",
      "depression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had\r\n",
      "dreamed of finding in her husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms and\r\n",
      "winding passages which seemed to lead nowhither? I suppose it was that\r\n",
      "in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and\r\n",
      "the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee\r\n",
      "delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal. But\r\n",
      "the door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is concentrated on\r\n",

      "some explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea did not see\r\n",
      "the bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the brokenness\r\n",
      "of their intercourse, and, supported by her faith in their future, she\r\n",

      "the matter-of-course statement and tone of dismissal with which he\r\n",
      "treated what to her were the most stirring thoughts, was easily\r\n",
      "accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in\r\n",
      "which she herself shared during their engagement. But now, since they\r\n",
      "had been in Rome, with all the depths of her emotion roused to\r\n",
      "tumultuous activity, and with life made a new problem by new elements,\r\n",

      "intention of acquitting himself worthily, but only of acquitting\r\n",
      "himself. What was fresh to her mind was worn out to his; and such\r\n",
      "capacity of thought and feeling as had ever been stimulated in him by\r\n",

      "of Cupid and Psyche, which is probably the romantic invention of a\r\n",

      "product. But if you like these wall-paintings we can easily drive\r\n",
      "thither; and you will then, I think, have seen the chief works of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This kind of answer given in a measured official tone, as of a\r\n",
      "clergyman reading according to the rubric, did not help to justify the\r\n",
      "glories of the Eternal City, or to give her the hope that if she knew\r\n",
      "more about them the world would be joyously illuminated for her. There\r\n",
      "is hardly any contact more depressing to a young ardent creature than\r\n",
      "that of a mind in which years full of knowledge seem to have issued in\r\n",
      "a blank absence of interest or sympathy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On other subjects indeed Mr. Casaubon showed a tenacity of occupation\r\n",
      "and an eagerness which are usually regarded as the effect of\r\n",
      "enthusiasm, and Dorothea was anxious to follow this spontaneous\r\n",
      "direction of his thoughts, instead of being made to feel that she\r\n",
      "dragged him away from it. But she was gradually ceasing to expect with\r\n",
      "her former delightful confidence that she should see any wide opening\r\n",
      "where she followed him. Poor Mr. Casaubon himself was lost among small\r\n",
      "closets and winding stairs, and in an agitated dimness about the\r\n",
      "Cabeiri, or in an exposure of other mythologists’ ill-considered\r\n",
      "parallels, easily lost sight of any purpose which had prompted him to\r\n",
      "these labors. With his taper stuck before him he forgot the absence of\r\n",
      "windows, and in bitter manuscript remarks on other men’s notions about\r\n",
      "the solar deities, he had become indifferent to the sunlight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon,\r\n",
      "might have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had been\r\n",
      "encouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling—if he would\r\n",
      "have held her hands between his and listened with the delight of\r\n",
      "tenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up\r\n",
      "her experience, and would have given her the same sort of intimacy in\r\n",
      "return, so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual\r\n",
      "knowledge and affection—or if she could have fed her affection with\r\n",
      "those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman, who\r\n",
      "has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll,\r\n",
      "creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own\r\n",
      "love. That was Dorothea’s bent. With all her yearning to know what was\r\n",
      "afar from her and to be widely benignant, she had ardor enough for what\r\n",
      "was near, to have kissed Mr. Casaubon’s coat-sleeve, or to have\r\n",
      "caressed his shoe-latchet, if he would have made any other sign of\r\n",
      "acceptance than pronouncing her, with his unfailing propriety, to be of\r\n",
      "a most affectionate and truly feminine nature, indicating at the same\r\n",
      "time by politely reaching a chair for her that he regarded these\r\n",
      "manifestations as rather crude and startling. Having made his clerical\r\n",
      "toilet with due care in the morning, he was prepared only for those\r\n",
      "amenities of life which were suited to the well-adjusted stiff cravat\r\n",
      "of the period, and to a mind weighted with unpublished matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And by a sad contradiction Dorothea’s ideas and resolves seemed like\r\n",
      "melting ice floating and lost in the warm flood of which they had been\r\n",
      "but another form. She was humiliated to find herself a mere victim of\r\n",
      "feeling, as if she could know nothing except through that medium: all\r\n",
      "her strength was scattered in fits of agitation, of struggle, of\r\n",
      "despondency, and then again in visions of more complete renunciation,\r\n",
      "transforming all hard conditions into duty. Poor Dorothea! she was\r\n",

      "first time she had been troublesome to Mr. Casaubon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "protracted beyond their anticipated period. I trust, however, that the\r\n",
      "time here has not been passed unpleasantly to you. Among the sights of\r\n",
      "Europe, that of Rome has ever been held one of the most striking and in\r\n",
      "some respects edifying. I well remember that I considered it an epoch\r\n",
      "in my life when I visited it for the first time; after the fall of\r\n",
      "Napoleon, an event which opened the Continent to travellers. Indeed I\r\n",
      "think it is one among several cities to which an extreme hyperbole has\r\n",
      "been applied—‘See Rome and die:’ but in your case I would propose an\r\n",
      "emendation and say, See Rome as a bride, and live henceforth as a happy\r\n",
      "wife.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon pronounced this little speech with the most conscientious\r\n",
      "intention, blinking a little and swaying his head up and down, and\r\n",
      "concluding with a smile. He had not found marriage a rapturous state,\r\n",
      "but he had no idea of being anything else than an irreproachable\r\n",
      "husband, who would make a charming young woman as happy as she deserved\r\n",
      "to be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope you are thoroughly satisfied with our stay—I mean, with the\r\n",
      "result so far as your studies are concerned,” said Dorothea, trying to\r\n",
      "keep her mind fixed on what most affected her husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mr. Casaubon, with that peculiar pitch of voice which makes\r\n",
      "the word half a negative. “I have been led farther than I had foreseen,\r\n",
      "and various subjects for annotation have presented themselves which,\r\n",
      "though I have no direct need of them, I could not pretermit. The task,\r\n",
      "notwithstanding the assistance of my amanuensis, has been a somewhat\r\n",
      "laborious one, but your society has happily prevented me from that too\r\n",
      "continuous prosecution of thought beyond the hours of study which has\r\n",
      "been the snare of my solitary life.”\r\n",

      "that Mr. Casaubon’s mind had gone too deep during the day to be able to\r\n",
      "get to the surface again. I fear there was a little temper in her\r\n",
      "reply. “I hope when we get to Lowick, I shall be more useful to you,\r\n",
      "and be able to enter a little more into what interests you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Doubtless, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon, with a slight bow. “The notes\r\n",

      "them under my direction.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And all your notes,” said Dorothea, whose heart had already burned\r\n",
      "within her on this subject, so that now she could not help speaking\r\n",
      "with her tongue. “All those rows of volumes—will you not now do what\r\n",
      "you used to speak of?—will you not make up your mind what part of them\r\n",
      "you will use, and begin to write the book which will make your vast\r\n",

      "will copy and extract what you tell me: I can be of no other use.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The excessive feeling manifested would alone have been highly\r\n",
      "disturbing to Mr. Casaubon, but there were other reasons why Dorothea’s\r\n",
      "words were among the most cutting and irritating to him that she could\r\n",
      "have been impelled to use. She was as blind to his inward troubles as\r\n",
      "he to hers: she had not yet learned those hidden conflicts in her\r\n",
      "husband which claim our pity. She had not yet listened patiently to his\r\n",
      "heartbeats, but only felt that her own was beating violently. In Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s ear, Dorothea’s voice gave loud emphatic iteration to those\r\n",
      "muffled suggestions of consciousness which it was possible to explain\r\n",
      "as mere fancy, the illusion of exaggerated sensitiveness: always when\r\n",
      "such suggestions are unmistakably repeated from without, they are\r\n",
      "resisted as cruel and unjust. We are angered even by the full\r\n",
      "acceptance of our humiliating confessions—how much more by hearing in\r\n",
      "hard distinct syllables from the lips of a near observer, those\r\n",
      "confused murmurs which we try to call morbid, and strive against as if\r\n",
      "they were the oncoming of numbness! And this cruel outward accuser was\r\n",
      "there in the shape of a wife—nay, of a young bride, who, instead of\r\n",
      "observing his abundant pen-scratches and amplitude of paper with the\r\n",
      "uncritical awe of an elegant-minded canary-bird, seemed to present\r\n",
      "herself as a spy watching everything with a malign power of inference.\r\n",
      "Here, towards this particular point of the compass, Mr. Casaubon had a\r\n",
      "sensitiveness to match Dorothea’s, and an equal quickness to imagine\r\n",
      "more than the fact. He had formerly observed with approbation her\r\n",
      "capacity for worshipping the right object; he now foresaw with sudden\r\n",
      "terror that this capacity might be replaced by presumption, this\r\n",
      "worship by the most exasperating of all criticism,—that which sees\r\n",
      "vaguely a great many fine ends, and has not the least notion what it\r\n",
      "costs to reach them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the first time since Dorothea had known him, Mr. Casaubon’s face\r\n",
      "had a quick angry flush upon it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My love,” he said, with irritation reined in by propriety, “you may\r\n",
      "rely upon me for knowing the times and the seasons, adapted to the\r\n",
      "different stages of a work which is not to be measured by the facile\r\n",
      "conjectures of ignorant onlookers. It had been easy for me to gain a\r\n",
      "temporary effect by a mirage of baseless opinion; but it is ever the\r\n",
      "trial of the scrupulous explorer to be saluted with the impatient scorn\r\n",
      "of chatterers who attempt only the smallest achievements, being indeed\r\n",
      "equipped for no other. And it were well if all such could be admonished\r\n",
      "to discriminate judgments of which the true subject-matter lies\r\n",
      "entirely beyond their reach, from those of which the elements may be\r\n",
      "compassed by a narrow and superficial survey.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This speech was delivered with an energy and readiness quite unusual\r\n",
      "with Mr. Casaubon. It was not indeed entirely an improvisation, but had\r\n",
      "taken shape in inward colloquy, and rushed out like the round grains\r\n",
      "from a fruit when sudden heat cracks it. Dorothea was not only his\r\n",
      "wife: she was a personification of that shallow world which surrounds\r\n",
      "the appreciated or desponding author.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was indignant in her turn. Had she not been repressing\r\n",
      "everything in herself except the desire to enter into some fellowship\r\n",
      "with her husband’s chief interests?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My judgment _was_ a very superficial one—such as I am capable of\r\n",
      "forming,” she answered, with a prompt resentment, that needed no\r\n",
      "rehearsal. “You showed me the rows of notebooks—you have often spoken\r\n",
      "of them—you have often said that they wanted digesting. But I never\r\n",
      "heard you speak of the writing that is to be published. Those were very\r\n",
      "simple facts, and my judgment went no farther. I only begged you to let\r\n",
      "me be of some good to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea rose to leave the table and Mr. Casaubon made no reply, taking\r\n",
      "up a letter which lay beside him as if to reperuse it. Both were\r\n",
      "shocked at their mutual situation—that each should have betrayed anger\r\n",
      "towards the other. If they had been at home, settled at Lowick in\r\n",
      "ordinary life among their neighbors, the clash would have been less\r\n",
      "embarrassing: but on a wedding journey, the express object of which is\r\n",
      "to isolate two people on the ground that they are all the world to each\r\n",
      "other, the sense of disagreement is, to say the least, confounding and\r\n",
      "stultifying. To have changed your longitude extensively and placed\r\n",
      "yourselves in a moral solitude in order to have small explosions, to\r\n",
      "find conversation difficult and to hand a glass of water without\r\n",
      "looking, can hardly be regarded as satisfactory fulfilment even to the\r\n",
      "toughest minds. To Dorothea’s inexperienced sensitiveness, it seemed\r\n",
      "like a catastrophe, changing all prospects; and to Mr. Casaubon it was\r\n",
      "a new pain, he never having been on a wedding journey before, or found\r\n",
      "himself in that close union which was more of a subjection than he had\r\n",
      "been able to imagine, since this charming young bride not only obliged\r\n",
      "him to much consideration on her behalf (which he had sedulously\r\n",
      "given), but turned out to be capable of agitating him cruelly just\r\n",
      "where he most needed soothing. Instead of getting a soft fence against\r\n",
      "the cold, shadowy, unapplausive audience of his life, had he only given\r\n",
      "it a more substantial presence?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Neither of them felt it possible to speak again at present. To have\r\n",
      "reversed a previous arrangement and declined to go out would have been\r\n",
      "a show of persistent anger which Dorothea’s conscience shrank from,\r\n",
      "seeing that she already began to feel herself guilty. However just her\r\n",
      "indignation might be, her ideal was not to claim justice, but to give\r\n",
      "tenderness. So when the carriage came to the door, she drove with Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon to the Vatican, walked with him through the stony avenue of\r\n",
      "inscriptions, and when she parted with him at the entrance to the\r\n",
      "Library, went on through the Museum out of mere listlessness as to what\r\n",
      "was around her. She had not spirit to turn round and say that she would\r\n",
      "drive anywhere. It was when Mr. Casaubon was quitting her that Naumann\r\n",
      "had first seen her, and he had entered the long gallery of sculpture at\r\n",
      "the same time with her; but here Naumann had to await Ladislaw with\r\n",
      "whom he was to settle a bet of champagne about an enigmatical\r\n",
      "mediaeval-looking figure there. After they had examined the figure, and\r\n",
      "had walked on finishing their dispute, they had parted, Ladislaw\r\n",
      "lingering behind while Naumann had gone into the Hall of Statues where\r\n",
      "he again saw Dorothea, and saw her in that brooding abstraction which\r\n",
      "made her pose remarkable. She did not really see the streak of sunlight\r\n",
      "on the floor more than she saw the statues: she was inwardly seeing the\r\n",
      "light of years to come in her own home and over the English fields and\r\n",
      "elms and hedge-bordered highroads; and feeling that the way in which\r\n",
      "they might be filled with joyful devotedness was not so clear to her as\r\n",
      "it had been. But in Dorothea’s mind there was a current into which all\r\n",
      "thought and feeling were apt sooner or later to flow—the reaching\r\n",
      "forward of the whole consciousness towards the fullest truth, the least\r\n",
      "partial good. There was clearly something better than anger and\r\n",

      "husband’s goodness, and make her feel that she had now the right to be\r\n",

      "usual. She met Ladislaw with that exquisite smile of good-will which is\r\n",
      "unmixed with vanity, and held out her hand to him. He was the elder by\r\n",
      "several years, but at that moment he looked much the younger, for his\r\n",
      "transparent complexion flushed suddenly, and he spoke with a shyness\r\n",
      "extremely unlike the ready indifference of his manner with his male\r\n",

      "stirred him with a sort of comic disgust: he was divided between the\r\n",
      "impulse to laugh aloud and the equally unseasonable impulse to burst\r\n",
      "into scornful invective.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For an instant he felt that the struggle was causing a queer contortion\r\n",
      "of his mobile features, but with a good effort he resolved it into\r\n",
      "nothing more offensive than a merry smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea wondered; but the smile was irresistible, and shone back from\r\n",
      "her face too. Will Ladislaw’s smile was delightful, unless you were\r\n",
      "angry with him beforehand: it was a gush of inward light illuminating\r\n",
      "the transparent skin as well as the eyes, and playing about every curve\r\n",
      "and line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm, and\r\n",
      "banishing forever the traces of moodiness. The reflection of that smile\r\n",
      "could not but have a little merriment in it too, even under dark\r\n",
      "eyelashes still moist, as Dorothea said inquiringly, “Something amuses\r\n",
      "you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Will, quick in finding resources. “I am thinking of the\r\n",
      "sort of figure I cut the first time I saw you, when you annihilated my\r\n",
      "poor sketch with your criticism.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My criticism?” said Dorothea, wondering still more. “Surely not. I\r\n",
      "always feel particularly ignorant about painting.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suspected you of knowing so much, that you knew how to say just what\r\n",
      "was most cutting. You said—I dare say you don’t remember it as I\r\n",
      "do—that the relation of my sketch to nature was quite hidden from you.\r\n",
      "At least, you implied that.” Will could laugh now as well as smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was really my ignorance,” said Dorothea, admiring Will’s\r\n",
      "good-humor. “I must have said so only because I never could see any\r\n",
      "beauty in the pictures which my uncle told me all judges thought very\r\n",
      "fine. And I have gone about with just the same ignorance in Rome. There\r\n",
      "are comparatively few paintings that I can really enjoy. At first when\r\n",
      "I enter a room where the walls are covered with frescos, or with rare\r\n",
      "pictures, I feel a kind of awe—like a child present at great ceremonies\r\n",
      "where there are grand robes and processions; I feel myself in the\r\n",
      "presence of some higher life than my own. But when I begin to examine\r\n",
      "the pictures one by one the life goes out of them, or else is something\r\n",
      "violent and strange to me. It must be my own dulness. I am seeing so\r\n",
      "much all at once, and not understanding half of it. That always makes\r\n",
      "one feel stupid. It is painful to be told that anything is very fine\r\n",
      "and not be able to feel that it is fine—something like being blind,\r\n",
      "while people talk of the sky.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, there is a great deal in the feeling for art which must be\r\n",
      "acquired,” said Will. (It was impossible now to doubt the directness of\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s confession.) “Art is an old language with a great many\r\n",
      "artificial affected styles, and sometimes the chief pleasure one gets\r\n",
      "out of knowing them is the mere sense of knowing. I enjoy the art of\r\n",
      "all sorts here immensely; but I suppose if I could pick my enjoyment to\r\n",
      "pieces I should find it made up of many different threads. There is\r\n",
      "something in daubing a little one’s self, and having an idea of the\r\n",
      "process.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You mean perhaps to be a painter?” said Dorothea, with a new direction\r\n",
      "of interest. “You mean to make painting your profession? Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "will like to hear that you have chosen a profession.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, oh no,” said Will, with some coldness. “I have quite made up my\r\n",
      "mind against it. It is too one-sided a life. I have been seeing a great\r\n",
      "deal of the German artists here: I travelled from Frankfort with one of\r\n",
      "them. Some are fine, even brilliant fellows—but I should not like to\r\n",
      "get into their way of looking at the world entirely from the studio\r\n",
      "point of view.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That I can understand,” said Dorothea, cordially. “And in Rome it\r\n",
      "seems as if there were so many things which are more wanted in the\r\n",
      "world than pictures. But if you have a genius for painting, would it\r\n",
      "not be right to take that as a guide? Perhaps you might do better\r\n",
      "things than these—or different, so that there might not be so many\r\n",
      "pictures almost all alike in the same place.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no mistaking this simplicity, and Will was won by it into\r\n",
      "frankness. “A man must have a very rare genius to make changes of that\r\n",
      "sort. I am afraid mine would not carry me even to the pitch of doing\r\n",
      "well what has been done already, at least not so well as to make it\r\n",
      "worth while. And I should never succeed in anything by dint of\r\n",
      "drudgery. If things don’t come easily to me I never get them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have heard Mr. Casaubon say that he regrets your want of patience,”\r\n",
      "said Dorothea, gently. She was rather shocked at this mode of taking\r\n",
      "all life as a holiday.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I know Mr. Casaubon’s opinion. He and I differ.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The slight streak of contempt in this hasty reply offended Dorothea.\r\n",
      "She was all the more susceptible about Mr. Casaubon because of her\r\n",
      "morning’s trouble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly you differ,” she said, rather proudly. “I did not think of\r\n",
      "comparing you: such power of persevering devoted labor as Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s is not common.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will saw that she was offended, but this only gave an additional\r\n",
      "impulse to the new irritation of his latent dislike towards Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon. It was too intolerable that Dorothea should be worshipping\r\n",
      "this husband: such weakness in a woman is pleasant to no man but the\r\n",
      "husband in question. Mortals are easily tempted to pinch the life out\r\n",
      "of their neighbor’s buzzing glory, and think that such killing is no\r\n",
      "murder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed,” he answered, promptly. “And therefore it is a pity that\r\n",
      "it should be thrown away, as so much English scholarship is, for want\r\n",
      "of knowing what is being done by the rest of the world. If Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "read German he would save himself a great deal of trouble.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do not understand you,” said Dorothea, startled and anxious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I merely mean,” said Will, in an offhand way, “that the Germans have\r\n",
      "taken the lead in historical inquiries, and they laugh at results which\r\n",
      "are got by groping about in woods with a pocket-compass while they have\r\n",
      "made good roads. When I was with Mr. Casaubon I saw that he deafened\r\n",
      "himself in that direction: it was almost against his will that he read\r\n",
      "a Latin treatise written by a German. I was very sorry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will only thought of giving a good pinch that would annihilate that\r\n",
      "vaunted laboriousness, and was unable to imagine the mode in which\r\n",
      "Dorothea would be wounded. Young Mr. Ladislaw was not at all deep\r\n",
      "himself in German writers; but very little achievement is required in\r\n",
      "order to pity another man’s shortcomings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Dorothea felt a pang at the thought that the labor of her\r\n",
      "husband’s life might be void, which left her no energy to spare for the\r\n",
      "question whether this young relative who was so much obliged to him\r\n",
      "ought not to have repressed his observation. She did not even speak,\r\n",
      "but sat looking at her hands, absorbed in the piteousness of that\r\n",
      "thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will, however, having given that annihilating pinch, was rather\r\n",
      "ashamed, imagining from Dorothea’s silence that he had offended her\r\n",
      "still more; and having also a conscience about plucking the\r\n",
      "tail-feathers from a benefactor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I regretted it especially,” he resumed, taking the usual course from\r\n",
      "detraction to insincere eulogy, “because of my gratitude and respect\r\n",
      "towards my cousin. It would not signify so much in a man whose talents\r\n",
      "and character were less distinguished.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea raised her eyes, brighter than usual with excited feeling, and\r\n",
      "said in her saddest recitative, “How I wish I had learned German when I\r\n",
      "was at Lausanne! There were plenty of German teachers. But now I can be\r\n",
      "of no use.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a new light, but still a mysterious light, for Will in\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s last words. The question how she had come to accept Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon—which he had dismissed when he first saw her by saying that\r\n",
      "she must be disagreeable in spite of appearances—was not now to be\r\n",
      "answered on any such short and easy method. Whatever else she might be,\r\n",
      "she was not disagreeable. She was not coldly clever and indirectly\r\n",
      "satirical, but adorably simple and full of feeling. She was an angel\r\n",
      "beguiled. It would be a unique delight to wait and watch for the\r\n",
      "melodious fragments in which her heart and soul came forth so directly\r\n",
      "and ingenuously. The Aeolian harp again came into his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She must have made some original romance for herself in this marriage.\r\n",
      "And if Mr. Casaubon had been a dragon who had carried her off to his\r\n",
      "lair with his talons simply and without legal forms, it would have been\r\n",
      "an unavoidable feat of heroism to release her and fall at her feet. But\r\n",
      "he was something more unmanageable than a dragon: he was a benefactor\r\n",
      "with collective society at his back, and he was at that moment entering\r\n",
      "the room in all the unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor, while\r\n",
      "Dorothea was looking animated with a newly roused alarm and regret, and\r\n",
      "Will was looking animated with his admiring speculation about her\r\n",
      "feelings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon felt a surprise which was quite unmixed with pleasure, but\r\n",
      "he did not swerve from his usual politeness of greeting, when Will rose\r\n",
      "and explained his presence. Mr. Casaubon was less happy than usual, and\r\n",
      "this perhaps made him look all the dimmer and more faded; else, the\r\n",
      "effect might easily have been produced by the contrast of his young\r\n",
      "cousin’s appearance. The first impression on seeing Will was one of\r\n",
      "sunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing\r\n",
      "expression. Surely, his very features changed their form, his jaw\r\n",
      "looked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in\r\n",
      "his nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he turned his head\r\n",
      "quickly his hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought\r\n",
      "they saw decided genius in this coruscation. Mr. Casaubon, on the\r\n",
      "contrary, stood rayless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Dorothea’s eyes were turned anxiously on her husband she was perhaps\r\n",
      "not insensible to the contrast, but it was only mingled with other\r\n",
      "causes in making her more conscious of that new alarm on his behalf\r\n",
      "which was the first stirring of a pitying tenderness fed by the\r\n",
      "realities of his lot and not by her own dreams. Yet it was a source of\r\n",
      "greater freedom to her that Will was there; his young equality was\r\n",
      "agreeable, and also perhaps his openness to conviction. She felt an\r\n",
      "immense need of some one to speak to, and she had never before seen any\r\n",
      "one who seemed so quick and pliable, so likely to understand\r\n",
      "everything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon gravely hoped that Will was passing his time profitably as\r\n",
      "well as pleasantly in Rome—had thought his intention was to remain in\r\n",
      "South Germany—but begged him to come and dine to-morrow, when he could\r\n",
      "converse more at large: at present he was somewhat weary. Ladislaw\r\n",
      "understood, and accepting the invitation immediately took his leave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s eyes followed her husband anxiously, while he sank down\r\n",
      "wearily at the end of a sofa, and resting his elbow supported his head\r\n",
      "and looked on the floor. A little flushed, and with bright eyes, she\r\n",
      "seated herself beside him, and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Forgive me for speaking so hastily to you this morning. I was wrong. I\r\n",
      "fear I hurt you and made the day more burdensome.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am glad that you feel that, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon. He spoke\r\n",
      "quietly and bowed his head a little, but there was still an uneasy\r\n",
      "feeling in his eyes as he looked at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you do forgive me?” said Dorothea, with a quick sob. In her need\r\n",
      "for some manifestation of feeling she was ready to exaggerate her own\r\n",
      "fault. Would not love see returning penitence afar off, and fall on its\r\n",
      "neck and kiss it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Dorothea—‘who with repentance is not satisfied, is not of\r\n",
      "heaven nor earth:’—you do not think me worthy to be banished by that\r\n",
      "severe sentence,” said Mr. Casaubon, exerting himself to make a strong\r\n",
      "statement, and also to smile faintly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was silent, but a tear which had come up with the sob would\r\n",
      "insist on falling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are excited, my dear. And I also am feeling some unpleasant\r\n",
      "consequences of too much mental disturbance,” said Mr. Casaubon. In\r\n",
      "fact, he had it in his thought to tell her that she ought not to have\r\n",
      "received young Ladislaw in his absence: but he abstained, partly from\r\n",
      "the sense that it would be ungracious to bring a new complaint in the\r\n",
      "moment of her penitent acknowledgment, partly because he wanted to\r\n",
      "avoid further agitation of himself by speech, and partly because he was\r\n",
      "too proud to betray that jealousy of disposition which was not so\r\n",
      "exhausted on his scholarly compeers that there was none to spare in\r\n",
      "other directions. There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little\r\n",
      "fire: it is hardly a passion, but a blight bred in the cloudy, damp\r\n",
      "despondency of uneasy egoism.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think it is time for us to dress,” he added, looking at his watch.\r\n",
      "They both rose, and there was never any further allusion between them\r\n",
      "to what had passed on this day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Dorothea remembered it to the last with the vividness with which we\r\n",
      "all remember epochs in our experience when some dear expectation dies,\r\n",
      "or some new motive is born. Today she had begun to see that she had\r\n",
      "been under a wild illusion in expecting a response to her feeling from\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon, and she had felt the waking of a presentiment that there\r\n",
      "might be a sad consciousness in his life which made as great a need on\r\n",
      "his side as on her own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder\r\n",
      "to feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early begun to emerge from\r\n",
      "that stupidity, but yet it had been easier to her to imagine how she\r\n",
      "would devote herself to Mr. Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his\r\n",
      "strength and wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is\r\n",
      "no longer reflection but feeling—an idea wrought back to the directness\r\n",
      "of sense, like the solidity of objects—that he had an equivalent centre\r\n",

      "gave no opportunity for Mr. Casaubon to show disapprobation. On the\r\n",
      "contrary it seemed to Dorothea that Will had a happier way of drawing\r\n",
      "her husband into conversation and of deferentially listening to him\r\n",
      "than she had ever observed in any one before. To be sure, the listeners\r\n",

      "was certainly one of his good days. He described touches of incident\r\n",
      "among the poor people in Rome, only to be seen by one who could move\r\n",
      "about freely; he found himself in agreement with Mr. Casaubon as to the\r\n",

      "you from seeing the world’s ages as a set of box-like partitions\r\n",
      "without vital connection. Mr. Casaubon’s studies, Will observed, had\r\n",
      "always been of too broad a kind for that, and he had perhaps never felt\r\n",
      "any such sudden effect, but for himself he confessed that Rome had\r\n",
      "given him quite a new sense of history as a whole: the fragments\r\n",
      "stimulated his imagination and made him constructive. Then\r\n",
      "occasionally, but not too often, he appealed to Dorothea, and discussed\r\n",
      "what she said, as if her sentiment were an item to be considered in the\r\n",
      "final judgment even of the Madonna di Foligno or the Laocoon. A sense\r\n",

      "that after a brief renewal he should have no further reason for staying\r\n",

      "without seeing a studio or two. Would not Mr. Casaubon take her? That\r\n",
      "sort of thing ought not to be missed: it was quite special: it was a\r\n",
      "form of life that grew like a small fresh vegetation with its\r\n",

      "tremendous course of the world’s physical history lashing on the\r\n",
      "harnessed dynasties. In my opinion, that is a good mythical\r\n",
      "interpretation.” Will here looked at Mr. Casaubon, who received this\r\n",
      "offhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily, and bowed with a neutral\r\n",
      "air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The sketch must be very grand, if it conveys so much,” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "“I should need some explanation even of the meaning you give. Do you\r\n",
      "intend Tamburlaine to represent earthquakes and volcanoes?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes,” said Will, laughing, “and migrations of races and clearings\r\n",
      "of forests—and America and the steam-engine. Everything you can\r\n",
      "imagine!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a difficult kind of shorthand!” said Dorothea, smiling towards\r\n",
      "her husband. “It would require all your knowledge to be able to read\r\n",
      "it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon blinked furtively at Will. He had a suspicion that he was\r\n",
      "being laughed at. But it was not possible to include Dorothea in the\r\n",
      "suspicion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They found Naumann painting industriously, but no model was present;\r\n",
      "his pictures were advantageously arranged, and his own plain vivacious\r\n",
      "person set off by a dove-colored blouse and a maroon velvet cap, so\r\n",
      "that everything was as fortunate as if he had expected the beautiful\r\n",
      "young English lady exactly at that time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The painter in his confident English gave little dissertations on his\r\n",
      "finished and unfinished subjects, seeming to observe Mr. Casaubon as\r\n",
      "much as he did Dorothea. Will burst in here and there with ardent words\r\n",
      "of praise, marking out particular merits in his friend’s work; and\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt that she was getting quite new notions as to the\r\n",
      "significance of Madonnas seated under inexplicable canopied thrones\r\n",
      "with the simple country as a background, and of saints with\r\n",
      "architectural models in their hands, or knives accidentally wedged in\r\n",
      "their skulls. Some things which had seemed monstrous to her were\r\n",
      "gathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning: but all this was\r\n",
      "apparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not\r\n",
      "interested himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than have to\r\n",
      "read it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures\r\n",
      "sooner than yours with the very wide meaning,” said Dorothea, speaking\r\n",
      "to Will.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t speak of my painting before Naumann,” said Will. “He will tell\r\n",
      "you, it is all _pfuscherei_, which is his most opprobrious word!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is that true?” said Dorothea, turning her sincere eyes on Naumann, who\r\n",
      "made a slight grimace and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, he does not mean it seriously with painting. His walk must be\r\n",
      "_belles-lettres_. That is wi-ide.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Naumann’s pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word\r\n",
      "satirically. Will did not half like it, but managed to laugh: and Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon, while he felt some disgust at the artist’s German accent,\r\n",
      "began to entertain a little respect for his judicious severity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The respect was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will aside\r\n",
      "for a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon, came forward again and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say that a\r\n",
      "sketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St. Thomas\r\n",
      "Aquinas in my picture there. It is too much to ask; but I so seldom see\r\n",
      "just what I want—the idealistic in the real.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You astonish me greatly, sir,” said Mr. Casaubon, his looks improved\r\n",
      "with a glow of delight; “but if my poor physiognomy, which I have been\r\n",
      "accustomed to regard as of the commonest order, can be of any use to\r\n",
      "you in furnishing some traits for the angelical doctor, I shall feel\r\n",
      "honored. That is to say, if the operation will not be a lengthy one;\r\n",
      "and if Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the delay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased her more, unless it had\r\n",
      "been a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and\r\n",
      "worthiest among the sons of men. In that case her tottering faith would\r\n",
      "have become firm again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Naumann’s apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness, and the\r\n",
      "sketch went on at once as well as the conversation. Dorothea sat down\r\n",
      "and subsided into calm silence, feeling happier than she had done for a\r\n",
      "long while before. Every one about her seemed good, and she said to\r\n",
      "herself that Rome, if she had only been less ignorant, would have been\r\n",
      "full of beauty: its sadness would have been winged with hope. No nature\r\n",
      "could be less suspicious than hers: when she was a child she believed\r\n",
      "in the gratitude of wasps and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows,\r\n",
      "and was proportionately indignant when their baseness was made\r\n",
      "manifest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English\r\n",
      "polities, which brought long answers, and, Will meanwhile had perched\r\n",
      "himself on some steps in the background overlooking all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently Naumann said—“Now if I could lay this by for half an hour and\r\n",
      "take it up again—come and look, Ladislaw—I think it is perfect so far.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is\r\n",
      "too strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah—now—if I could but have had more—but you have other engagements—I\r\n",
      "could not ask it—or even to come again to-morrow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, let us stay!” said Dorothea. “We have nothing to do to-day except\r\n",
      "go about, have we?” she added, looking entreatingly at Mr. Casaubon.\r\n",
      "“It would be a pity not to make the head as good as possible.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am at your service, sir, in the matter,” said Mr. Casaubon, with\r\n",
      "polite condescension. “Having given up the interior of my head to\r\n",
      "idleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are unspeakably good—now I am happy!” said Naumann, and then went\r\n",
      "on in German to Will, pointing here and there to the sketch as if he\r\n",
      "were considering that. Putting it aside for a moment, he looked round\r\n",
      "vaguely, as if seeking some occupation for his visitors, and afterwards\r\n",
      "turning to Mr. Casaubon, said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling\r\n",
      "to let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of\r\n",
      "her—not, of course, as you see, for that picture—only as a single\r\n",
      "study.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him,\r\n",
      "and Dorothea said, at once, “Where shall I put myself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Naumann was all apologies in asking her to stand, and allow him to\r\n",
      "adjust her attitude, to which she submitted without any of the affected\r\n",
      "airs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when\r\n",
      "the painter said, “It is as Santa Clara that I want you to\r\n",
      "stand—leaning so, with your cheek against your hand—so—looking at that\r\n",
      "stool, please, so!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint’s feet\r\n",
      "and kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he\r\n",
      "was adjusting her arm. All this was impudence and desecration, and he\r\n",
      "repented that he had brought her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The artist was diligent, and Will recovering himself moved about and\r\n",
      "occupied Mr. Casaubon as ingeniously as he could; but he did not in the\r\n",
      "end prevent the time from seeming long to that gentleman, as was clear\r\n",
      "from his expressing a fear that Mrs. Casaubon would be tired. Naumann\r\n",
      "took the hint and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, sir, if you can oblige me again; I will release the lady-wife.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So Mr. Casaubon’s patience held out further, and when after all it\r\n",
      "turned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect\r\n",
      "if another sitting could be had, it was granted for the morrow. On the\r\n",
      "morrow Santa Clara too was retouched more than once. The result of all\r\n",
      "was so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon, that he arranged for the\r\n",
      "purchase of the picture in which Saint Thomas Aquinas sat among the\r\n",
      "doctors of the Church in a disputation too abstract to be represented,\r\n",
      "but listened to with more or less attention by an audience above. The\r\n",
      "Santa Clara, which was spoken of in the second place, Naumann declared\r\n",
      "himself to be dissatisfied with—he could not, in conscience, engage to\r\n",
      "make a worthy picture of it; so about the Santa Clara the arrangement\r\n",
      "was conditional.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I will not dwell on Naumann’s jokes at the expense of Mr. Casaubon that\r\n",
      "evening, or on his dithyrambs about Dorothea’s charm, in all which Will\r\n",
      "joined, but with a difference. No sooner did Naumann mention any detail\r\n",
      "of Dorothea’s beauty, than Will got exasperated at his presumption:\r\n",
      "there was grossness in his choice of the most ordinary words, and what\r\n",
      "business had he to talk of her lips? She was not a woman to be spoken\r\n",
      "of as other women were. Will could not say just what he thought, but he\r\n",
      "became irritable. And yet, when after some resistance he had consented\r\n",
      "to take the Casaubons to his friend’s studio, he had been allured by\r\n",
      "the gratification of his pride in being the person who could grant\r\n",
      "Naumann such an opportunity of studying her loveliness—or rather her\r\n",
      "divineness, for the ordinary phrases which might apply to mere bodily\r\n",
      "prettiness were not applicable to her. (Certainly all Tipton and its\r\n",
      "neighborhood, as well as Dorothea herself, would have been surprised at\r\n",
      "her beauty being made so much of. In that part of the world Miss Brooke\r\n",
      "had been only a “fine young woman.”)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oblige me by letting the subject drop, Naumann. Mrs. Casaubon is not\r\n",
      "to be talked of as if she were a model,” said Will. Naumann stared at\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Schön! I will talk of my Aquinas. The head is not a bad type, after\r\n",
      "all. I dare say the great scholastic himself would have been flattered\r\n",
      "to have his portrait asked for. Nothing like these starchy doctors for\r\n",
      "vanity! It was as I thought: he cared much less for her portrait than\r\n",
      "his own.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s a cursed white-blooded pedantic coxcomb,” said Will, with\r\n",
      "gnashing impetuosity. His obligations to Mr. Casaubon were not known to\r\n",
      "his hearer, but Will himself was thinking of them, and wishing that he\r\n",
      "could discharge them all by a check.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Naumann gave a shrug and said, “It is good they go away soon, my dear.\r\n",
      "They are spoiling your fine temper.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All Will’s hope and contrivance were now concentrated on seeing\r\n",
      "Dorothea when she was alone. He only wanted her to take more emphatic\r\n",
      "notice of him; he only wanted to be something more special in her\r\n",
      "remembrance than he could yet believe himself likely to be. He was\r\n",
      "rather impatient under that open ardent good-will, which he saw was her\r\n",
      "usual state of feeling. The remote worship of a woman throned out of\r\n",
      "their reach plays a great part in men’s lives, but in most cases the\r\n",
      "worshipper longs for some queenly recognition, some approving sign by\r\n",
      "which his soul’s sovereign may cheer him without descending from her\r\n",
      "high place. That was precisely what Will wanted. But there were plenty\r\n",
      "of contradictions in his imaginative demands. It was beautiful to see\r\n",
      "how Dorothea’s eyes turned with wifely anxiety and beseeching to Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon: she would have lost some of her halo if she had been without\r\n",
      "that duteous preoccupation; and yet at the next moment the husband’s\r\n",
      "sandy absorption of such nectar was too intolerable; and Will’s longing\r\n",
      "to say damaging things about him was perhaps not the less tormenting\r\n",
      "because he felt the strongest reasons for restraining it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will had not been invited to dine the next day. Hence he persuaded\r\n",
      "himself that he was bound to call, and that the only eligible time was\r\n",
      "the middle of the day, when Mr. Casaubon would not be at home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea, who had not been made aware that her former reception of Will\r\n",
      "had displeased her husband, had no hesitation about seeing him,\r\n",
      "especially as he might be come to pay a farewell visit. When he entered\r\n",
      "she was looking at some cameos which she had been buying for Celia. She\r\n",
      "greeted Will as if his visit were quite a matter of course, and said at\r\n",
      "once, having a cameo bracelet in her hand—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am so glad you are come. Perhaps you understand all about cameos,\r\n",
      "and can tell me if these are really good. I wished to have you with us\r\n",
      "in choosing them, but Mr. Casaubon objected: he thought there was not\r\n",
      "time. He will finish his work to-morrow, and we shall go away in three\r\n",
      "days. I have been uneasy about these cameos. Pray sit down and look at\r\n",
      "them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not particularly knowing, but there can be no great mistake about\r\n",
      "these little Homeric bits: they are exquisitely neat. And the color is\r\n",
      "fine: it will just suit you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, they are for my sister, who has quite a different complexion. You\r\n",
      "saw her with me at Lowick: she is light-haired and very pretty—at least\r\n",
      "I think so. We were never so long away from each other in our lives\r\n",
      "before. She is a great pet and never was naughty in her life. I found\r\n",
      "out before I came away that she wanted me to buy her some cameos, and I\r\n",
      "should be sorry for them not to be good—after their kind.” Dorothea\r\n",
      "added the last words with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem not to care about cameos,” said Will, seating himself at some\r\n",
      "distance from her, and observing her while she closed the cases.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, frankly, I don’t think them a great object in life,” said\r\n",
      "Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I fear you are a heretic about art generally. How is that? I should\r\n",
      "have expected you to be very sensitive to the beautiful everywhere.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose I am dull about many things,” said Dorothea, simply. “I\r\n",
      "should like to make life beautiful—I mean everybody’s life. And then\r\n",
      "all this immense expense of art, that seems somehow to lie outside life\r\n",
      "and make it no better for the world, pains one. It spoils my enjoyment\r\n",
      "of anything when I am made to think that most people are shut out from\r\n",
      "it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I call that the fanaticism of sympathy,” said Will, impetuously. “You\r\n",
      "might say the same of landscape, of poetry, of all refinement. If you\r\n",
      "carried it out you ought to be miserable in your own goodness, and turn\r\n",
      "evil that you might have no advantage over others. The best piety is to\r\n",
      "enjoy—when you can. You are doing the most then to save the earth’s\r\n",
      "character as an agreeable planet. And enjoyment radiates. It is of no\r\n",
      "use to try and take care of all the world; that is being taken care of\r\n",
      "when you feel delight—in art or in anything else. Would you turn all\r\n",
      "the youth of the world into a tragic chorus, wailing and moralizing\r\n",
      "over misery? I suspect that you have some false belief in the virtues\r\n",
      "of misery, and want to make your life a martyrdom.” Will had gone\r\n",
      "further than he intended, and checked himself. But Dorothea’s thought\r\n",
      "was not taking just the same direction as his own, and she answered\r\n",
      "without any special emotion—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed you mistake me. I am not a sad, melancholy creature. I am never\r\n",
      "unhappy long together. I am angry and naughty—not like Celia: I have a\r\n",
      "great outburst, and then all seems glorious again. I cannot help\r\n",
      "believing in glorious things in a blind sort of way. I should be quite\r\n",
      "willing to enjoy the art here, but there is so much that I don’t know\r\n",
      "the reason of—so much that seems to me a consecration of ugliness\r\n",
      "rather than beauty. The painting and sculpture may be wonderful, but\r\n",
      "the feeling is often low and brutal, and sometimes even ridiculous.\r\n",
      "Here and there I see what takes me at once as noble—something that I\r\n",
      "might compare with the Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian\r\n",
      "Hill; but that makes it the greater pity that there is so little of the\r\n",
      "best kind among all that mass of things over which men have toiled so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course there is always a great deal of poor work: the rarer things\r\n",
      "want that soil to grow in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh dear,” said Dorothea, taking up that thought into the chief current\r\n",
      "of her anxiety; “I see it must be very difficult to do anything good. I\r\n",
      "have often felt since I have been in Rome that most of our lives would\r\n",
      "look much uglier and more bungling than the pictures, if they could be\r\n",
      "put on the wall.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea parted her lips again as if she were going to say more, but\r\n",
      "changed her mind and paused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are too young—it is an anachronism for you to have such thoughts,”\r\n",
      "said Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head habitual to\r\n",
      "him. “You talk as if you had never known any youth. It is monstrous—as\r\n",
      "if you had had a vision of Hades in your childhood, like the boy in the\r\n",
      "legend. You have been brought up in some of those horrible notions that\r\n",
      "choose the sweetest women to devour—like Minotaurs. And now you will go\r\n",
      "and be shut up in that stone prison at Lowick: you will be buried\r\n",
      "alive. It makes me savage to think of it! I would rather never have\r\n",
      "seen you than think of you with such a prospect.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we attach\r\n",
      "to words depends on our feeling, and his tone of angry regret had so\r\n",
      "much kindness in it for Dorothea’s heart, which had always been giving\r\n",
      "out ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings\r\n",
      "around her, that she felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a\r\n",
      "gentle smile—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is very good of you to be anxious about me. It is because you did\r\n",
      "not like Lowick yourself: you had set your heart on another kind of\r\n",
      "life. But Lowick is my chosen home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and Will\r\n",
      "did not know what to say, since it would not be useful for him to\r\n",
      "embrace her slippers, and tell her that he would die for her: it was\r\n",
      "clear that she required nothing of the sort; and they were both silent\r\n",
      "for a moment or two, when Dorothea began again with an air of saying at\r\n",
      "last what had been in her mind beforehand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wanted to ask you again about something you said the other day.\r\n",
      "Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that\r\n",
      "you like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak\r\n",
      "hastily.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What was it?” said Will, observing that she spoke with a timidity\r\n",
      "quite new in her. “I have a hyperbolical tongue: it catches fire as it\r\n",
      "goes. I dare say I shall have to retract.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I mean what you said about the necessity of knowing German—I mean, for\r\n",
      "the subjects that Mr. Casaubon is engaged in. I have been thinking\r\n",
      "about it; and it seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon’s learning he must\r\n",
      "have before him the same materials as German scholars—has he not?”\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s timidity was due to an indistinct consciousness that she was\r\n",
      "in the strange situation of consulting a third person about the\r\n",
      "adequacy of Mr. Casaubon’s learning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not exactly the same materials,” said Will, thinking that he would be\r\n",
      "duly reserved. “He is not an Orientalist, you know. He does not profess\r\n",
      "to have more than second-hand knowledge there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But there are very valuable books about antiquities which were written\r\n",
      "a long while ago by scholars who knew nothing about these modern\r\n",
      "things; and they are still used. Why should Mr. Casaubon’s not be\r\n",
      "valuable, like theirs?” said Dorothea, with more remonstrant energy.\r\n",
      "She was impelled to have the argument aloud, which she had been having\r\n",
      "in her own mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That depends on the line of study taken,” said Will, also getting a\r\n",
      "tone of rejoinder. “The subject Mr. Casaubon has chosen is as changing\r\n",
      "as chemistry: new discoveries are constantly making new points of view.\r\n",
      "Who wants a system on the basis of the four elements, or a book to\r\n",
      "refute Paracelsus? Do you not see that it is no use now to be crawling\r\n",
      "a little way after men of the last century—men like Bryant—and\r\n",
      "correcting their mistakes?—living in a lumber-room and furbishing up\r\n",
      "broken-legged theories about Chus and Mizraim?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can you bear to speak so lightly?” said Dorothea, with a look\r\n",
      "between sorrow and anger. “If it were as you say, what could be sadder\r\n",
      "than so much ardent labor all in vain? I wonder it does not affect you\r\n",
      "more painfully, if you really think that a man like Mr. Casaubon, of so\r\n",
      "much goodness, power, and learning, should in any way fail in what has\r\n",
      "been the labor of his best years.” She was beginning to be shocked that\r\n",
      "she had got to such a point of supposition, and indignant with Will for\r\n",
      "having led her to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You questioned me about the matter of fact, not of feeling,” said\r\n",
      "Will. “But if you wish to punish me for the fact, I submit. I am not in\r\n",
      "a position to express my feeling toward Mr. Casaubon: it would be at\r\n",
      "best a pensioner’s eulogy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray excuse me,” said Dorothea, coloring deeply. “I am aware, as you\r\n",
      "say, that I am in fault in having introduced the subject. Indeed, I am\r\n",
      "wrong altogether. Failure after long perseverance is much grander than\r\n",
      "never to have a striving good enough to be called a failure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I quite agree with you,” said Will, determined to change the\r\n",
      "situation—“so much so that I have made up my mind not to run that risk\r\n",
      "of never attaining a failure. Mr. Casaubon’s generosity has perhaps\r\n",
      "been dangerous to me, and I mean to renounce the liberty it has given\r\n",
      "me. I mean to go back to England shortly and work my own way—depend on\r\n",
      "nobody else than myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is fine—I respect that feeling,” said Dorothea, with returning\r\n",
      "kindness. “But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, has never thought of anything\r\n",
      "in the matter except what was most for your welfare.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She has obstinacy and pride enough to serve instead of love, now she\r\n",
      "has married him,” said Will to himself. Aloud he said, rising—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall not see you again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, stay till Mr. Casaubon comes,” said Dorothea, earnestly. “I am so\r\n",
      "glad we met in Rome. I wanted to know you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And I have made you angry,” said Will. “I have made you think ill of\r\n",
      "me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no. My sister tells me I am always angry with people who do not say\r\n",
      "just what I like. But I hope I am not given to think ill of them. In\r\n",
      "the end I am usually obliged to think ill of myself for being so\r\n",
      "impatient.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Still, you don’t like me; I have made myself an unpleasant thought to\r\n",
      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all,” said Dorothea, with the most open kindness. “I like you\r\n",
      "very much.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was not quite contented, thinking that he would apparently have\r\n",
      "been of more importance if he had been disliked. He said nothing, but\r\n",
      "looked dull, not to say sulky.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And I am quite interested to see what you will do,” Dorothea went on\r\n",
      "cheerfully. “I believe devoutly in a natural difference of vocation. If\r\n",
      "it were not for that belief, I suppose I should be very narrow—there\r\n",
      "are so many things, besides painting, that I am quite ignorant of. You\r\n",
      "would hardly believe how little I have taken in of music and\r\n",
      "literature, which you know so much of. I wonder what your vocation will\r\n",
      "turn out to be: perhaps you will be a poet?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That depends. To be a poet is to have a soul so quick to discern that\r\n",
      "no shade of quality escapes it, and so quick to feel, that discernment\r\n",
      "is but a hand playing with finely ordered variety on the chords of\r\n",
      "emotion—a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling,\r\n",
      "and feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge. One may have that\r\n",
      "condition by fits only.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you leave out the poems,” said Dorothea. “I think they are wanted\r\n",
      "to complete the poet. I understand what you mean about knowledge\r\n",
      "passing into feeling, for that seems to be just what I experience. But\r\n",
      "I am sure I could never produce a poem.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You _are_ a poem—and that is to be the best part of a poet—what makes\r\n",
      "up the poet’s consciousness in his best moods,” said Will, showing such\r\n",
      "originality as we all share with the morning and the spring-time and\r\n",
      "other endless renewals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very glad to hear it,” said Dorothea, laughing out her words in a\r\n",
      "bird-like modulation, and looking at Will with playful gratitude in her\r\n",
      "eyes. “What very kind things you say to me!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish I could ever do anything that would be what you call kind—that\r\n",
      "I could ever be of the slightest service to you. I fear I shall never\r\n",
      "have the opportunity.” Will spoke with fervor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes,” said Dorothea, cordially. “It will come; and I shall remember\r\n",
      "how well you wish me. I quite hoped that we should be friends when I\r\n",
      "first saw you—because of your relationship to Mr. Casaubon.” There was\r\n",
      "a certain liquid brightness in her eyes, and Will was conscious that\r\n",
      "his own were obeying a law of nature and filling too. The allusion to\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon would have spoiled all if anything at that moment could\r\n",
      "have spoiled the subduing power, the sweet dignity, of her noble\r\n",
      "unsuspicious inexperience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And there is one thing even now that you can do,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "rising and walking a little way under the strength of a recurring\r\n",
      "impulse. “Promise me that you will not again, to any one, speak of that\r\n",
      "subject—I mean about Mr. Casaubon’s writings—I mean in that kind of\r\n",
      "way. It was I who led to it. It was my fault. But promise me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had returned from her brief pacing and stood opposite Will, looking\r\n",
      "gravely at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly, I will promise you,” said Will, reddening however. If he\r\n",
      "never said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left off\r\n",
      "receiving favors from him, it would clearly be permissible to hate him\r\n",
      "the more. The poet must know how to hate, says Goethe; and Will was at\r\n",
      "least ready with that accomplishment. He said that he must go now\r\n",
      "without waiting for Mr. Casaubon, whom he would come to take leave of\r\n",
      "at the last moment. Dorothea gave him her hand, and they exchanged a\r\n",
      "simple “Good-by.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But going out of the _porte cochere_ he met Mr. Casaubon, and that\r\n",
      "gentleman, expressing the best wishes for his cousin, politely waived\r\n",
      "the pleasure of any further leave-taking on the morrow, which would be\r\n",
      "sufficiently crowded with the preparations for departure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have something to tell you about our cousin Mr. Ladislaw, which I\r\n",
      "think will heighten your opinion of him,” said Dorothea to her husband\r\n",
      "in the course of the evening. She had mentioned immediately on his\r\n",
      "entering that Will had just gone away, and would come again, but Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon had said, “I met him outside, and we made our final adieux, I\r\n",
      "believe,” saying this with the air and tone by which we imply that any\r\n",
      "subject, whether private or public, does not interest us enough to wish\r\n",
      "for a further remark upon it. So Dorothea had waited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is that, my love?” said Mr Casaubon (he always said “my love”\r\n",
      "when his manner was the coldest).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has made up his mind to leave off wandering at once, and to give up\r\n",
      "his dependence on your generosity. He means soon to go back to England,\r\n",
      "and work his own way. I thought you would consider that a good sign,”\r\n",
      "said Dorothea, with an appealing look into her husband’s neutral face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would\r\n",
      "addict himself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No. But he said that he felt the danger which lay for him in your\r\n",
      "generosity. Of course he will write to you about it. Do you not think\r\n",
      "better of him for his resolve?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall await his communication on the subject,” said Mr. Casaubon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I told him I was sure that the thing you considered in all you did for\r\n",
      "him was his own welfare. I remembered your goodness in what you said\r\n",
      "about him when I first saw him at Lowick,” said Dorothea, putting her\r\n",
      "hand on her husband’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I had a duty towards him,” said Mr. Casaubon, laying his other hand on\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s in conscientious acceptance of her caress, but with a glance\r\n",
      "which he could not hinder from being uneasy. “The young man, I confess,\r\n",
      "is not otherwise an object of interest to me, nor need we, I think,\r\n",
      "discuss his future course, which it is not ours to determine beyond the\r\n",

      "for many hours together, there were circumstances connected with this\r\n",
      "debt which made the thought of it unusually importunate. The creditor\r\n",
      "was Mr. Bambridge, a horse-dealer of the neighborhood, whose company\r\n",
      "was much sought in Middlemarch by young men understood to be “addicted\r\n",
      "to pleasure.” During the vacations Fred had naturally required more\r\n",

      "the accidental expense of ruining a fine hunter, but also to make a\r\n",
      "small advance by which he might be able to meet some losses at\r\n",

      "at disposal in his own hopefulness. You will hardly demand that his\r\n",
      "confidence should have a basis in external facts; such confidence, we\r\n",
      "know, is something less coarse and materialistic: it is a comfortable\r\n",
      "disposition leading us to expect that the wisdom of providence or the\r\n",
      "folly of our friends, the mysteries of luck or the still greater\r\n",
      "mystery of our high individual value in the universe, will bring about\r\n",
      "agreeable issues, such as are consistent with our good taste in\r\n",
      "costume, and our general preference for the best style of thing. Fred\r\n",
      "felt sure that he should have a present from his uncle, that he should\r\n",

      "metamorphose a horse worth forty pounds into a horse that would fetch a\r\n",

      "which only a morbid distrust could imagine, Fred had always (at that\r\n",
      "time) his father’s pocket as a last resource, so that his assets of\r\n",
      "hopefulness had a sort of gorgeous superfluity about them. Of what\r\n",
      "might be the capacity of his father’s pocket, Fred had only a vague\r\n",
      "notion: was not trade elastic? And would not the deficiencies of one\r\n",
      "year be made up for by the surplus of another? The Vincys lived in an\r\n",
      "easy profuse way, not with any new ostentation, but according to the\r\n",
      "family habits and traditions, so that the children had no standard of\r\n",
      "economy, and the elder ones retained some of their infantine notion\r\n",
      "that their father might pay for anything if he would. Mr. Vincy himself\r\n",
      "had expensive Middlemarch habits—spent money on coursing, on his\r\n",
      "cellar, and on dinner-giving, while mamma had those running accounts\r\n",
      "with tradespeople, which give a cheerful sense of getting everything\r\n",
      "one wants without any question of payment. But it was in the nature of\r\n",
      "fathers, Fred knew, to bully one about expenses: there was always a\r\n",
      "little storm over his extravagance if he had to disclose a debt, and\r\n",
      "Fred disliked bad weather within doors. He was too filial to be\r\n",
      "disrespectful to his father, and he bore the thunder with the certainty\r\n",
      "that it was transient; but in the mean time it was disagreeable to see\r\n",
      "his mother cry, and also to be obliged to look sulky instead of having\r\n",
      "fun; for Fred was so good-tempered that if he looked glum under\r\n",
      "scolding, it was chiefly for propriety’s sake. The easier course\r\n",
      "plainly, was to renew the bill with a friend’s signature. Why not? With\r\n",
      "the superfluous securities of hope at his command, there was no reason\r\n",
      "why he should not have increased other people’s liabilities to any\r\n",
      "extent, but for the fact that men whose names were good for anything\r\n",
      "were usually pessimists, indisposed to believe that the universal order\r\n",
      "of things would necessarily be agreeable to an agreeable young\r\n",
      "gentleman.\r\n",

      "With a favor to ask we review our list of friends, do justice to their\r\n",
      "more amiable qualities, forgive their little offenses, and concerning\r\n",

      "oblige us, our own eagerness to be obliged being as communicable as\r\n",
      "other warmth. Still there is always a certain number who are dismissed\r\n",

      "he at least (whatever might be maintained about mankind generally) had\r\n",

      "Thus it came to pass that the friend whom he chose to apply to was at\r\n",
      "once the poorest and the kindest—namely, Caleb Garth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Garths were very fond of Fred, as he was of them; for when he and\r\n",
      "Rosamond were little ones, and the Garths were better off, the slight\r\n",
      "connection between the two families through Mr. Featherstone’s double\r\n",
      "marriage (the first to Mr. Garth’s sister, and the second to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Vincy’s) had led to an acquaintance which was carried on between the\r\n",
      "children rather than the parents: the children drank tea together out\r\n",
      "of their toy teacups, and spent whole days together in play. Mary was a\r\n",
      "little hoyden, and Fred at six years old thought her the nicest girl in\r\n",
      "the world, making her his wife with a brass ring which he had cut from\r\n",
      "an umbrella. Through all the stages of his education he had kept his\r\n",
      "affection for the Garths, and his habit of going to their house as a\r\n",
      "second home, though any intercourse between them and the elders of his\r\n",
      "family had long ceased. Even when Caleb Garth was prosperous, the\r\n",
      "Vincys were on condescending terms with him and his wife, for there\r\n",
      "were nice distinctions of rank in Middlemarch; and though old\r\n",
      "manufacturers could not any more than dukes be connected with none but\r\n",
      "equals, they were conscious of an inherent social superiority which was\r\n",
      "defined with great nicety in practice, though hardly expressible\r\n",
      "theoretically. Since then Mr. Garth had failed in the building\r\n",
      "business, which he had unfortunately added to his other avocations of\r\n",
      "surveyor, valuer, and agent, had conducted that business for a time\r\n",
      "entirely for the benefit of his assignees, and had been living\r\n",
      "narrowly, exerting himself to the utmost that he might after all pay\r\n",
      "twenty shillings in the pound. He had now achieved this, and from all\r\n",
      "who did not think it a bad precedent, his honorable exertions had won\r\n",
      "him due esteem; but in no part of the world is genteel visiting founded\r\n",
      "on esteem, in the absence of suitable furniture and complete\r\n",
      "dinner-service. Mrs. Vincy had never been at her ease with Mrs. Garth,\r\n",
      "and frequently spoke of her as a woman who had had to work for her\r\n",
      "bread—meaning that Mrs. Garth had been a teacher before her marriage;\r\n",
      "in which case an intimacy with Lindley Murray and Mangnall’s Questions\r\n",
      "was something like a draper’s discrimination of calico trademarks, or a\r\n",
      "courier’s acquaintance with foreign countries: no woman who was better\r\n",
      "off needed that sort of thing. And since Mary had been keeping Mr.\r\n",
      "Featherstone’s house, Mrs. Vincy’s want of liking for the Garths had\r\n",
      "been converted into something more positive, by alarm lest Fred should\r\n",
      "engage himself to this plain girl, whose parents “lived in such a small\r\n",
      "way.” Fred, being aware of this, never spoke at home of his visits to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth, which had of late become more frequent, the increasing\r\n",
      "ardor of his affection for Mary inclining him the more towards those\r\n",
      "who belonged to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Garth had a small office in the town, and to this Fred went with\r\n",
      "his request. He obtained it without much difficulty, for a large amount\r\n",
      "of painful experience had not sufficed to make Caleb Garth cautious\r\n",
      "about his own affairs, or distrustful of his fellow-men when they had\r\n",
      "not proved themselves untrustworthy; and he had the highest opinion of\r\n",
      "Fred, was “sure the lad would turn out well—an open affectionate\r\n",
      "fellow, with a good bottom to his character—you might trust him for\r\n",
      "anything.” Such was Caleb’s psychological argument. He was one of those\r\n",
      "rare men who are rigid to themselves and indulgent to others. He had a\r\n",
      "certain shame about his neighbors’ errors, and never spoke of them\r\n",
      "willingly; hence he was not likely to divert his mind from the best\r\n",
      "mode of hardening timber and other ingenious devices in order to\r\n",
      "preconceive those errors. If he had to blame any one, it was necessary\r\n",
      "for him to move all the papers within his reach, or describe various\r\n",
      "diagrams with his stick, or make calculations with the odd money in his\r\n",
      "pocket, before he could begin; and he would rather do other men’s work\r\n",
      "than find fault with their doing. I fear he was a bad disciplinarian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Fred stated the circumstances of his debt, his wish to meet it\r\n",
      "without troubling his father, and the certainty that the money would be\r\n",
      "forthcoming so as to cause no one any inconvenience, Caleb pushed his\r\n",
      "spectacles upward, listened, looked into his favorite’s clear young\r\n",
      "eyes, and believed him, not distinguishing confidence about the future\r\n",
      "from veracity about the past; but he felt that it was an occasion for a\r\n",
      "friendly hint as to conduct, and that before giving his signature he\r\n",
      "must give a rather strong admonition. Accordingly, he took the paper\r\n",
      "and lowered his spectacles, measured the space at his command, reached\r\n",
      "his pen and examined it, dipped it in the ink and examined it again,\r\n",
      "then pushed the paper a little way from him, lifted up his spectacles\r\n",
      "again, showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his bushy\r\n",
      "eyebrows, which gave his face a peculiar mildness (pardon these details\r\n",
      "for once—you would have learned to love them if you had known Caleb\r\n",
      "Garth), and said in a comfortable tone,—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was a misfortune, eh, that breaking the horse’s knees? And then,\r\n",
      "these exchanges, they don’t answer when you have ’cute jockeys to deal\r\n",
      "with. You’ll be wiser another time, my boy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whereupon Caleb drew down his spectacles, and proceeded to write his\r\n",
      "signature with the care which he always gave to that performance; for\r\n",
      "whatever he did in the way of business he did well. He contemplated the\r\n",
      "large well-proportioned letters and final flourish, with his head a\r\n",
      "trifle on one side for an instant, then handed it to Fred, said\r\n",
      "“Good-by,” and returned forthwith to his absorption in a plan for Sir\r\n",
      "James Chettam’s new farm-buildings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Either because his interest in this work thrust the incident of the\r\n",
      "signature from his memory, or for some reason of which Caleb was more\r\n",
      "conscious, Mrs. Garth remained ignorant of the affair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Since it occurred, a change had come over Fred’s sky, which altered his\r\n",
      "view of the distance, and was the reason why his uncle Featherstone’s\r\n",
      "present of money was of importance enough to make his color come and\r\n",
      "go, first with a too definite expectation, and afterwards with a\r\n",
      "proportionate disappointment. His failure in passing his examination,\r\n",
      "had made his accumulation of college debts the more unpardonable by his\r\n",
      "father, and there had been an unprecedented storm at home. Mr. Vincy\r\n",
      "had sworn that if he had anything more of that sort to put up with,\r\n",
      "Fred should turn out and get his living how he could; and he had never\r\n",
      "yet quite recovered his good-humored tone to his son, who had\r\n",
      "especially enraged him by saying at this stage of things that he did\r\n",
      "not want to be a clergyman, and would rather not “go on with that.”\r\n",
      "Fred was conscious that he would have been yet more severely dealt with\r\n",
      "if his family as well as himself had not secretly regarded him as Mr.\r\n",
      "Featherstone’s heir; that old gentleman’s pride in him, and apparent\r\n",
      "fondness for him, serving in the stead of more exemplary conduct—just\r\n",
      "as when a youthful nobleman steals jewellery we call the act\r\n",
      "kleptomania, speak of it with a philosophical smile, and never think of\r\n",
      "his being sent to the house of correction as if he were a ragged boy\r\n",
      "who had stolen turnips. In fact, tacit expectations of what would be\r\n",
      "done for him by uncle Featherstone determined the angle at which most\r\n",
      "people viewed Fred Vincy in Middlemarch; and in his own consciousness,\r\n",
      "what uncle Featherstone would do for him in an emergency, or what he\r\n",
      "would do simply as an incorporated luck, formed always an immeasurable\r\n",
      "depth of aerial perspective. But that present of bank-notes, once made,\r\n",
      "was measurable, and being applied to the amount of the debt, showed a\r\n",
      "deficit which had still to be filled up either by Fred’s “judgment” or\r\n",
      "by luck in some other shape. For that little episode of the alleged\r\n",
      "borrowing, in which he had made his father the agent in getting the\r\n",
      "Bulstrode certificate, was a new reason against going to his father for\r\n",
      "money towards meeting his actual debt. Fred was keen enough to foresee\r\n",
      "that anger would confuse distinctions, and that his denial of having\r\n",
      "borrowed expressly on the strength of his uncle’s will would be taken\r\n",
      "as a falsehood. He had gone to his father and told him one vexatious\r\n",
      "affair, and he had left another untold: in such cases the complete\r\n",
      "revelation always produces the impression of a previous duplicity. Now\r\n",
      "Fred piqued himself on keeping clear of lies, and even fibs; he often\r\n",
      "shrugged his shoulders and made a significant grimace at what he called\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s fibs (it is only brothers who can associate such ideas with\r\n",
      "a lovely girl); and rather than incur the accusation of falsehood he\r\n",
      "would even incur some trouble and self-restraint. It was under strong\r\n",
      "inward pressure of this kind that Fred had taken the wise step of\r\n",
      "depositing the eighty pounds with his mother. It was a pity that he had\r\n",
      "not at once given them to Mr. Garth; but he meant to make the sum\r\n",
      "complete with another sixty, and with a view to this, he had kept\r\n",
      "twenty pounds in his own pocket as a sort of seed-corn, which, planted\r\n",
      "by judgment, and watered by luck, might yield more than threefold—a\r\n",
      "very poor rate of multiplication when the field is a young gentleman’s\r\n",
      "infinite soul, with all the numerals at command.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred was not a gambler: he had not that specific disease in which the\r\n",
      "suspension of the whole nervous energy on a chance or risk becomes as\r\n",
      "necessary as the dram to the drunkard; he had only the tendency to that\r\n",
      "diffusive form of gambling which has no alcoholic intensity, but is\r\n",
      "carried on with the healthiest chyle-fed blood, keeping up a joyous\r\n",
      "imaginative activity which fashions events according to desire, and\r\n",
      "having no fears about its own weather, only sees the advantage there\r\n",
      "must be to others in going aboard with it. Hopefulness has a pleasure\r\n",
      "in making a throw of any kind, because the prospect of success is\r\n",
      "certain; and only a more generous pleasure in offering as many as\r\n",
      "possible a share in the stake. Fred liked play, especially billiards,\r\n",
      "as he liked hunting or riding a steeple-chase; and he only liked it the\r\n",
      "better because he wanted money and hoped to win. But the twenty pounds’\r\n",
      "worth of seed-corn had been planted in vain in the seductive green\r\n",
      "plot—all of it at least which had not been dispersed by the\r\n",
      "roadside—and Fred found himself close upon the term of payment with no\r\n",
      "money at command beyond the eighty pounds which he had deposited with\r\n",
      "his mother. The broken-winded horse which he rode represented a present\r\n",
      "which had been made to him a long while ago by his uncle Featherstone:\r\n",
      "his father always allowed him to keep a horse, Mr. Vincy’s own habits\r\n",
      "making him regard this as a reasonable demand even for a son who was\r\n",
      "rather exasperating. This horse, then, was Fred’s property, and in his\r\n",
      "anxiety to meet the imminent bill he determined to sacrifice a\r\n",
      "possession without which life would certainly be worth little. He made\r\n",
      "the resolution with a sense of heroism—heroism forced on him by the\r\n",
      "dread of breaking his word to Mr. Garth, by his love for Mary and awe\r\n",
      "of her opinion. He would start for Houndsley horse-fair which was to be\r\n",
      "held the next morning, and—simply sell his horse, bringing back the\r\n",
      "money by coach?—Well, the horse would hardly fetch more than thirty\r\n",
      "pounds, and there was no knowing what might happen; it would be folly\r\n",
      "to balk himself of luck beforehand. It was a hundred to one that some\r\n",
      "good chance would fall in his way; the longer he thought of it, the\r\n",
      "less possible it seemed that he should not have a good chance, and the\r\n",
      "less reasonable that he should not equip himself with the powder and\r\n",
      "shot for bringing it down. He would ride to Houndsley with Bambridge\r\n",
      "and with Horrock “the vet,” and without asking them anything expressly,\r\n",
      "he should virtually get the benefit of their opinion. Before he set\r\n",
      "out, Fred got the eighty pounds from his mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Most of those who saw Fred riding out of Middlemarch in company with\r\n",
      "Bambridge and Horrock, on his way of course to Houndsley horse-fair,\r\n",
      "thought that young Vincy was pleasure-seeking as usual; and but for an\r\n",
      "unwonted consciousness of grave matters on hand, he himself would have\r\n",
      "had a sense of dissipation, and of doing what might be expected of a\r\n",
      "gay young fellow. Considering that Fred was not at all coarse, that he\r\n",
      "rather looked down on the manners and speech of young men who had not\r\n",
      "been to the university, and that he had written stanzas as pastoral and\r\n",
      "unvoluptuous as his flute-playing, his attraction towards Bambridge and\r\n",
      "Horrock was an interesting fact which even the love of horse-flesh\r\n",
      "would not wholly account for without that mysterious influence of\r\n",
      "Naming which determinates so much of mortal choice. Under any other\r\n",
      "name than “pleasure” the society of Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock\r\n",
      "must certainly have been regarded as monotonous; and to arrive with\r\n",
      "them at Houndsley on a drizzling afternoon, to get down at the Red Lion\r\n",
      "in a street shaded with coal-dust, and dine in a room furnished with a\r\n",
      "dirt-enamelled map of the county, a bad portrait of an anonymous horse\r\n",
      "in a stable, His Majesty George the Fourth with legs and cravat, and\r\n",
      "various leaden spittoons, might have seemed a hard business, but for\r\n",
      "the sustaining power of nomenclature which determined that the pursuit\r\n",
      "of these things was “gay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Mr. Horrock there was certainly an apparent unfathomableness which\r\n",
      "offered play to the imagination. Costume, at a glance, gave him a\r\n",
      "thrilling association with horses (enough to specify the hat-brim which\r\n",
      "took the slightest upward angle just to escape the suspicion of bending\r\n",
      "downwards), and nature had given him a face which by dint of Mongolian\r\n",
      "eyes, and a nose, mouth, and chin seeming to follow his hat-brim in a\r\n",
      "moderate inclination upwards, gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable\r\n",
      "sceptical smile, of all expressions the most tyrannous over a\r\n",
      "susceptible mind, and, when accompanied by adequate silence, likely to\r\n",
      "create the reputation of an invincible understanding, an infinite fund\r\n",
      "of humor—too dry to flow, and probably in a state of immovable\r\n",
      "crust,—and a critical judgment which, if you could ever be fortunate\r\n",
      "enough to know it, would be _the_ thing and no other. It is a\r\n",
      "physiognomy seen in all vocations, but perhaps it has never been more\r\n",
      "powerful over the youth of England than in a judge of horses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Horrock, at a question from Fred about his horse’s fetlock, turned\r\n",
      "sideways in his saddle, and watched the horse’s action for the space of\r\n",
      "three minutes, then turned forward, twitched his own bridle, and\r\n",
      "remained silent with a profile neither more nor less sceptical than it\r\n",
      "had been.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The part thus played in dialogue by Mr. Horrock was terribly effective.\r\n",
      "A mixture of passions was excited in Fred—a mad desire to thrash\r\n",
      "Horrock’s opinion into utterance, restrained by anxiety to retain the\r\n",
      "advantage of his friendship. There was always the chance that Horrock\r\n",
      "might say something quite invaluable at the right moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bambridge had more open manners, and appeared to give forth his\r\n",
      "ideas without economy. He was loud, robust, and was sometimes spoken of\r\n",
      "as being “given to indulgence”—chiefly in swearing, drinking, and\r\n",
      "beating his wife. Some people who had lost by him called him a vicious\r\n",
      "man; but he regarded horse-dealing as the finest of the arts, and might\r\n",
      "have argued plausibly that it had nothing to do with morality. He was\r\n",
      "undeniably a prosperous man, bore his drinking better than others bore\r\n",
      "their moderation, and, on the whole, flourished like the green\r\n",
      "bay-tree. But his range of conversation was limited, and like the fine\r\n",
      "old tune, “Drops of brandy,” gave you after a while a sense of\r\n",
      "returning upon itself in a way that might make weak heads dizzy. But a\r\n",
      "slight infusion of Mr. Bambridge was felt to give tone and character to\r\n",
      "several circles in Middlemarch; and he was a distinguished figure in\r\n",
      "the bar and billiard-room at the Green Dragon. He knew some anecdotes\r\n",
      "about the heroes of the turf, and various clever tricks of Marquesses\r\n",
      "and Viscounts which seemed to prove that blood asserted its\r\n",
      "pre-eminence even among black-legs; but the minute retentiveness of his\r\n",
      "memory was chiefly shown about the horses he had himself bought and\r\n",
      "sold; the number of miles they would trot you in no time without\r\n",
      "turning a hair being, after the lapse of years, still a subject of\r\n",
      "passionate asseveration, in which he would assist the imagination of\r\n",
      "his hearers by solemnly swearing that they never saw anything like it.\r\n",
      "In short, Mr. Bambridge was a man of pleasure and a gay companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred was subtle, and did not tell his friends that he was going to\r\n",
      "Houndsley bent on selling his horse: he wished to get indirectly at\r\n",
      "their genuine opinion of its value, not being aware that a genuine\r\n",
      "opinion was the last thing likely to be extracted from such eminent\r\n",
      "critics. It was not Mr. Bambridge’s weakness to be a gratuitous\r\n",
      "flatterer. He had never before been so much struck with the fact that\r\n",
      "this unfortunate bay was a roarer to a degree which required the\r\n",
      "roundest word for perdition to give you any idea of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You made a bad hand at swapping when you went to anybody but me,\r\n",
      "Vincy! Why, you never threw your leg across a finer horse than that\r\n",
      "chestnut, and you gave him for this brute. If you set him cantering, he\r\n",
      "goes on like twenty sawyers. I never heard but one worse roarer in my\r\n",
      "life, and that was a roan: it belonged to Pegwell, the corn-factor; he\r\n",
      "used to drive him in his gig seven years ago, and he wanted me to take\r\n",
      "him, but I said, ‘Thank you, Peg, I don’t deal in wind-instruments.’\r\n",
      "That was what I said. It went the round of the country, that joke did.\r\n",
      "But, what the hell! the horse was a penny trumpet to that roarer of\r\n",
      "yours.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, you said just now his was worse than mine,” said Fred, more\r\n",
      "irritable than usual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I said a lie, then,” said Mr. Bambridge, emphatically. “There wasn’t a\r\n",
      "penny to choose between ’em.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred spurred his horse, and they trotted on a little way. When they\r\n",
      "slackened again, Mr. Bambridge said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not but what the roan was a better trotter than yours.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m quite satisfied with his paces, I know,” said Fred, who required\r\n",
      "all the consciousness of being in gay company to support him; “I say\r\n",
      "his trot is an uncommonly clean one, eh, Horrock?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Horrock looked before him with as complete a neutrality as if he\r\n",
      "had been a portrait by a great master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred gave up the fallacious hope of getting a genuine opinion; but on\r\n",
      "reflection he saw that Bambridge’s depreciation and Horrock’s silence\r\n",
      "were both virtually encouraging, and indicated that they thought better\r\n",
      "of the horse than they chose to say.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That very evening, indeed, before the fair had set in, Fred thought he\r\n",
      "saw a favorable opening for disposing advantageously of his horse, but\r\n",
      "an opening which made him congratulate himself on his foresight in\r\n",
      "bringing with him his eighty pounds. A young farmer, acquainted with\r\n",
      "Mr. Bambridge, came into the Red Lion, and entered into conversation\r\n",
      "about parting with a hunter, which he introduced at once as Diamond,\r\n",
      "implying that it was a public character. For himself he only wanted a\r\n",
      "useful hack, which would draw upon occasion; being about to marry and\r\n",
      "to give up hunting. The hunter was in a friend’s stable at some little\r\n",
      "distance; there was still time for gentlemen to see it before dark. The\r\n",
      "friend’s stable had to be reached through a back street where you might\r\n",
      "as easily have been poisoned without expense of drugs as in any grim\r\n",
      "street of that unsanitary period. Fred was not fortified against\r\n",
      "disgust by brandy, as his companions were, but the hope of having at\r\n",
      "last seen the horse that would enable him to make money was\r\n",
      "exhilarating enough to lead him over the same ground again the first\r\n",
      "thing in the morning. He felt sure that if he did not come to a bargain\r\n",
      "with the farmer, Bambridge would; for the stress of circumstances, Fred\r\n",
      "felt, was sharpening his acuteness and endowing him with all the\r\n",
      "constructive power of suspicion. Bambridge had run down Diamond in a\r\n",
      "way that he never would have done (the horse being a friend’s) if he\r\n",
      "had not thought of buying it; every one who looked at the animal—even\r\n",
      "Horrock—was evidently impressed with its merit. To get all the\r\n",
      "advantage of being with men of this sort, you must know how to draw\r\n",
      "your inferences, and not be a spoon who takes things literally. The\r\n",
      "color of the horse was a dappled gray, and Fred happened to know that\r\n",
      "Lord Medlicote’s man was on the look-out for just such a horse. After\r\n",
      "all his running down, Bambridge let it out in the course of the\r\n",
      "evening, when the farmer was absent, that he had seen worse horses go\r\n",
      "for eighty pounds. Of course he contradicted himself twenty times over,\r\n",
      "but when you know what is likely to be true you can test a man’s\r\n",
      "admissions. And Fred could not but reckon his own judgment of a horse\r\n",
      "as worth something. The farmer had paused over Fred’s respectable\r\n",
      "though broken-winded steed long enough to show that he thought it worth\r\n",
      "consideration, and it seemed probable that he would take it, with\r\n",
      "five-and-twenty pounds in addition, as the equivalent of Diamond. In\r\n",
      "that case Fred, when he had parted with his new horse for at least\r\n",
      "eighty pounds, would be fifty-five pounds in pocket by the transaction,\r\n",
      "and would have a hundred and thirty-five pounds towards meeting the\r\n",
      "bill; so that the deficit temporarily thrown on Mr. Garth would at the\r\n",
      "utmost be twenty-five pounds. By the time he was hurrying on his\r\n",
      "clothes in the morning, he saw so clearly the importance of not losing\r\n",
      "this rare chance, that if Bambridge and Horrock had both dissuaded him,\r\n",
      "he would not have been deluded into a direct interpretation of their\r\n",
      "purpose: he would have been aware that those deep hands held something\r\n",
      "else than a young fellow’s interest. With regard to horses, distrust\r\n",
      "was your only clew. But scepticism, as we know, can never be thoroughly\r\n",
      "applied, else life would come to a standstill: something we must\r\n",
      "believe in and do, and whatever that something may be called, it is\r\n",
      "virtually our own judgment, even when it seems like the most slavish\r\n",
      "reliance on another. Fred believed in the excellence of his bargain,\r\n",
      "and even before the fair had well set in, had got possession of the\r\n",
      "dappled gray, at the price of his old horse and thirty pounds in\r\n",
      "addition—only five pounds more than he had expected to give.\r\n",

      "brought into his stable; and before meeting that lesser annoyance Fred\r\n",
      "wanted to get away with all his courage to face the greater. He took\r\n",
      "his father’s nag, for he had made up his mind that when he had told Mr.\r\n",

      "Mr. Garth was not at the office, and Fred rode on to his house, which\r\n",
      "was a little way outside the town—a homely place with an orchard in\r\n",
      "front of it, a rambling, old-fashioned, half-timbered building, which\r\n",
      "before the town had spread had been a farm-house, but was now\r\n",

      "of our houses if they have a physiognomy of their own, as our friends\r\n",

      "all the best furniture had long been sold. Fred liked it too, knowing\r\n",
      "it by heart even to the attic which smelt deliciously of apples and\r\n",
      "quinces, and until to-day he had never come to it without pleasant\r\n",
      "expectations; but his heart beat uneasily now with the sense that he\r\n",
      "should probably have to make his confession before Mrs. Garth, of whom\r\n",
      "he was rather more in awe than of her husband. Not that she was\r\n",
      "inclined to sarcasm and to impulsive sallies, as Mary was. In her\r\n",
      "present matronly age at least, Mrs. Garth never committed herself by\r\n",
      "over-hasty speech; having, as she said, borne the yoke in her youth,\r\n",
      "and learned self-control. She had that rare sense which discerns what\r\n",
      "is unalterable, and submits to it without murmuring. Adoring her\r\n",
      "husband’s virtues, she had very early made up her mind to his\r\n",
      "incapacity of minding his own interests, and had met the consequences\r\n",
      "cheerfully. She had been magnanimous enough to renounce all pride in\r\n",
      "teapots or children’s frilling, and had never poured any pathetic\r\n",
      "confidences into the ears of her feminine neighbors concerning Mr.\r\n",
      "Garth’s want of prudence and the sums he might have had if he had been\r\n",
      "like other men. Hence these fair neighbors thought her either proud or\r\n",
      "eccentric, and sometimes spoke of her to their husbands as “your fine\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth.” She was not without her criticism of them in return, being\r\n",
      "more accurately instructed than most matrons in Middlemarch, and—where\r\n",
      "is the blameless woman?—apt to be a little severe towards her own sex,\r\n",
      "which in her opinion was framed to be entirely subordinate. On the\r\n",
      "other hand, she was disproportionately indulgent towards the failings\r\n",
      "of men, and was often heard to say that these were natural. Also, it\r\n",
      "must be admitted that Mrs. Garth was a trifle too emphatic in her\r\n",
      "resistance to what she held to be follies: the passage from governess\r\n",
      "into housewife had wrought itself a little too strongly into her\r\n",
      "consciousness, and she rarely forgot that while her grammar and accent\r\n",
      "were above the town standard, she wore a plain cap, cooked the family\r\n",
      "dinner, and darned all the stockings. She had sometimes taken pupils in\r\n",
      "a peripatetic fashion, making them follow her about in the kitchen with\r\n",
      "their book or slate. She thought it good for them to see that she could\r\n",
      "make an excellent lather while she corrected their blunders “without\r\n",
      "looking,”—that a woman with her sleeves tucked up above her elbows\r\n",
      "might know all about the Subjunctive Mood or the Torrid Zone—that, in\r\n",
      "short, she might possess “education” and other good things ending in\r\n",
      "“tion,” and worthy to be pronounced emphatically, without being a\r\n",
      "useless doll. When she made remarks to this edifying effect, she had a\r\n",
      "firm little frown on her brow, which yet did not hinder her face from\r\n",
      "looking benevolent, and her words which came forth like a procession\r\n",
      "were uttered in a fervid agreeable contralto. Certainly, the exemplary\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth had her droll aspects, but her character sustained her\r\n",
      "oddities, as a very fine wine sustains a flavor of skin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Towards Fred Vincy she had a motherly feeling, and had always been\r\n",

      "excused Mary for engaging herself to him, her daughter being included\r\n",
      "in that more rigorous judgment which she applied to her own sex. But\r\n",
      "this very fact of her exceptional indulgence towards him made it the\r\n",
      "harder to Fred that he must now inevitably sink in her opinion. And the\r\n",
      "circumstances of his visit turned out to be still more unpleasant than\r\n",
      "he had expected; for Caleb Garth had gone out early to look at some\r\n",
      "repairs not far off. Mrs. Garth at certain hours was always in the\r\n",
      "kitchen, and this morning she was carrying on several occupations at\r\n",
      "once there—making her pies at the well-scoured deal table on one side\r\n",
      "of that airy room, observing Sally’s movements at the oven and\r\n",
      "dough-tub through an open door, and giving lessons to her youngest boy\r\n",
      "and girl, who were standing opposite to her at the table with their\r\n",
      "books and slates before them. A tub and a clothes-horse at the other\r\n",

      "going on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth, with her sleeves turned above her elbows, deftly handling\r\n",
      "her pastry—applying her rolling-pin and giving ornamental pinches,\r\n",
      "while she expounded with grammatical fervor what were the right views\r\n",
      "about the concord of verbs and pronouns with “nouns of multitude or\r\n",
      "signifying many,” was a sight agreeably amusing. She was of the same\r\n",
      "curly-haired, square-faced type as Mary, but handsomer, with more\r\n",
      "delicacy of feature, a pale skin, a solid matronly figure, and a\r\n",
      "remarkable firmness of glance. In her snowy-frilled cap she reminded\r\n",
      "one of that delightful Frenchwoman whom we have all seen marketing,\r\n",
      "basket on arm. Looking at the mother, you might hope that the daughter\r\n",
      "would become like her, which is a prospective advantage equal to a\r\n",

      "to speak about very plain things. How do you think you would write or\r\n",
      "speak about anything more difficult, if you knew no more of grammar\r\n",
      "than he does? You would use wrong words, and put words in the wrong\r\n",

      "“He was a wise man, like my father, and that made the people want his\r\n",
      "advice. And he was a brave man, and could fight. And so could my\r\n",
      "father—couldn’t he, mother?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, Ben, let me tell the story straight on, as mother told it us,”\r\n",

      "frowning, as if you wanted to conquer with your elbows! Cincinnatus, I\r\n",
      "am sure, would have been sorry to see his daughter behave so.” (Mrs.\r\n",
      "Garth delivered this awful sentence with much majesty of enunciation,\r\n",
      "and Letty felt that between repressed volubility and general disesteem,\r\n",
      "that of the Romans inclusive, life was already a painful affair.) “Now,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "He could not depart from his usual practice of going to see Mrs. Garth\r\n",
      "in the kitchen if she happened to be at work there. He put his arm\r\n",

      "“Are Letty and Ben your only pupils now, Mrs. Garth?” said Fred, when\r\n",
      "the children were gone and it was needful to say something that would\r\n",
      "pass the time. He was not yet sure whether he should wait for Mr.\r\n",
      "Garth, or use any good opportunity in conversation to confess to Mrs.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“One—only one. Fanny Hackbutt comes at half past eleven. I am not\r\n",
      "getting a great income now,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling. “I am at a low\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This did not lead well towards the news that Mr. Garth was on the brink\r\n",

      "explanation. Caleb blushed, and after a little pause said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I didn’t tell you, Susan: I put my name to a bill for Fred; it was\r\n",

      "keel were a-making, the signal-shouts of the workmen, the roar of the\r\n",
      "furnace, the thunder and plash of the engine, were a sublime music to\r\n",
      "him; the felling and lading of timber, and the huge trunk vibrating\r\n",
      "star-like in the distance along the highway, the crane at work on the\r\n",
      "wharf, the piled-up produce in warehouses, the precision and variety of\r\n",
      "muscular effort wherever exact work had to be turned out,—all these\r\n",
      "sights of his youth had acted on him as poetry without the aid of the\r\n",
      "poets, had made a philosophy for him without the aid of philosophers, a\r\n",
      "religion without the aid of theology. His early ambition had been to\r\n",
      "have as effective a share as possible in this sublime labor, which was\r\n",
      "peculiarly dignified by him with the name of “business;” and though he\r\n",
      "had only been a short time under a surveyor, and had been chiefly his\r\n",

      "His classification of human employments was rather crude, and, like the\r\n",
      "categories of more celebrated men, would not be acceptable in these\r\n",
      "advanced times. He divided them into “business, politics, preaching,\r\n",
      "learning, and amusement.” He had nothing to say against the last four;\r\n",
      "but he regarded them as a reverential pagan regarded other gods than\r\n",
      "his own. In the same way, he thought very well of all ranks, but he\r\n",
      "would not himself have liked to be of any rank in which he had not such\r\n",
      "close contact with “business” as to get often honorably decorated with\r\n",
      "marks of dust and mortar, the damp of the engine, or the sweet soil of\r\n",
      "the woods and fields. Though he had never regarded himself as other\r\n",
      "than an orthodox Christian, and would argue on prevenient grace if the\r\n",
      "subject were proposed to him, I think his virtual divinities were good\r\n",
      "practical schemes, accurate work, and the faithful completion of\r\n",
      "undertakings: his prince of darkness was a slack workman. But there was\r\n",

      "firmaments, if they did not obviously interfere with the best\r\n",
      "land-drainage, solid building, correct measuring, and judicious boring\r\n",
      "(for coal). In fact, he had a reverential soul with a strong practical\r\n",
      "intelligence. But he could not manage finance: he knew values well, but\r\n",
      "he had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of\r\n",
      "profit and loss: and having ascertained this to his cost, he determined\r\n",
      "to give up all forms of his beloved “business” which required that\r\n",
      "talent. He gave himself up entirely to the many kinds of work which he\r\n",
      "could do without handling capital, and was one of those precious men\r\n",
      "within his own district whom everybody would choose to work for them,\r\n",

      "was not at all fond of having to talk with Mr. Featherstone. The old\r\n",
      "man, on the other hand, felt himself ill at ease with a brother-in-law\r\n",
      "whom he could not annoy, who did not mind about being considered poor,\r\n",
      "had nothing to ask of him, and understood all kinds of farming and\r\n",
      "mining business better than he did. But Mary had felt sure that her\r\n",
      "parents would want to see her, and if her father had not come, she\r\n",
      "would have obtained leave to go home for an hour or two the next day.\r\n",
      "After discussing prices during tea with Mr. Featherstone, Caleb rose to\r\n",
      "bid him good-by, and said, “I want to speak to you, Mary.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She took a candle into another large parlor, where there was no fire,\r\n",
      "and setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table, turned\r\n",
      "round to her father, and putting her arms round his neck kissed him\r\n",
      "with childish kisses which he delighted in,—the expression of his large\r\n",
      "brows softening as the expression of a great beautiful dog softens when\r\n",
      "it is caressed. Mary was his favorite child, and whatever Susan might\r\n",
      "say, and right as she was on all other subjects, Caleb thought it\r\n",
      "natural that Fred or any one else should think Mary more lovable than\r\n",
      "other girls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve got something to tell you, my dear,” said Caleb in his hesitating\r\n",
      "way. “No very good news; but then it might be worse.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“About money, father? I think I know what it is.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ay? how can that be? You see, I’ve been a bit of a fool again, and put\r\n",
      "my name to a bill, and now it comes to paying; and your mother has got\r\n",
      "to part with her savings, that’s the worst of it, and even they won’t\r\n",
      "quite make things even. We wanted a hundred and ten pounds: your mother\r\n",
      "has ninety-two, and I have none to spare in the bank; and she thinks\r\n",
      "that you have some savings.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes; I have more than four-and-twenty pounds. I thought you would\r\n",
      "come, father, so I put it in my bag. See! beautiful white notes and\r\n",
      "gold.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary took out the folded money from her reticule and put it into her\r\n",
      "father’s hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, but how—we only want eighteen—here, put the rest back,\r\n",
      "child,—but how did you know about it?” said Caleb, who, in his\r\n",
      "unconquerable indifference to money, was beginning to be chiefly\r\n",
      "concerned about the relation the affair might have to Mary’s\r\n",
      "affections.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fred told me this morning.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! Did he come on purpose?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I think so. He was a good deal distressed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m afraid Fred is not to be trusted, Mary,” said the father, with\r\n",
      "hesitating tenderness. “He means better than he acts, perhaps. But I\r\n",
      "should think it a pity for any body’s happiness to be wrapped up in\r\n",
      "him, and so would your mother.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And so should I, father,” said Mary, not looking up, but putting the\r\n",
      "back of her father’s hand against her cheek.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t want to pry, my dear. But I was afraid there might be\r\n",
      "something between you and Fred, and I wanted to caution you. You see,\r\n",
      "Mary”—here Caleb’s voice became more tender; he had been pushing his\r\n",
      "hat about on the table and looking at it, but finally he turned his\r\n",
      "eyes on his daughter—“a woman, let her be as good as she may, has got\r\n",
      "to put up with the life her husband makes for her. Your mother has had\r\n",
      "to put up with a good deal because of me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary turned the back of her father’s hand to her lips and smiled at\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, well, nobody’s perfect, but”—here Mr. Garth shook his head to\r\n",
      "help out the inadequacy of words—“what I am thinking of is—what it must\r\n",
      "be for a wife when she’s never sure of her husband, when he hasn’t got\r\n",
      "a principle in him to make him more afraid of doing the wrong thing by\r\n",
      "others than of getting his own toes pinched. That’s the long and the\r\n",
      "short of it, Mary. Young folks may get fond of each other before they\r\n",
      "know what life is, and they may think it all holiday if they can only\r\n",
      "get together; but it soon turns into working day, my dear. However, you\r\n",
      "have more sense than most, and you haven’t been kept in cotton-wool:\r\n",
      "there may be no occasion for me to say this, but a father trembles for\r\n",
      "his daughter, and you are all by yourself here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t fear for me, father,” said Mary, gravely meeting her father’s\r\n",
      "eyes; “Fred has always been very good to me; he is kind-hearted and\r\n",
      "affectionate, and not false, I think, with all his self-indulgence. But\r\n",
      "I will never engage myself to one who has no manly independence, and\r\n",
      "who goes on loitering away his time on the chance that others will\r\n",
      "provide for him. You and my mother have taught me too much pride for\r\n",
      "that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s right—that’s right. Then I am easy,” said Mr. Garth, taking up\r\n",
      "his hat. “But it’s hard to run away with your earnings, eh child.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Father!” said Mary, in her deepest tone of remonstrance. “Take\r\n",
      "pocketfuls of love besides to them all at home,” was her last word\r\n",
      "before he closed the outer door on himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose your father wanted your earnings,” said old Mr.\r\n",
      "Featherstone, with his usual power of unpleasant surmise, when Mary\r\n",
      "returned to him. “He makes but a tight fit, I reckon. You’re of age\r\n",
      "now; you ought to be saving for yourself.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Featherstone grunted: he could not deny that an ordinary sort of\r\n",
      "girl like her might be expected to be useful, so he thought of another\r\n",
      "rejoinder, disagreeable enough to be always apropos. “If Fred Vincy\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Fred did not go to Stone Court the next day, for reasons that were\r\n",
      "quite peremptory. From those visits to unsanitary Houndsley streets in\r\n",
      "search of Diamond, he had brought back not only a bad bargain in\r\n",
      "horse-flesh, but the further misfortune of some ailment which for a day\r\n",
      "or two had deemed mere depression and headache, but which got so much\r\n",
      "worse when he returned from his visit to Stone Court that, going into\r\n",

      "due value for the Vincys’ house, but the wariest men are apt to be\r\n",
      "dulled by routine, and on worried mornings will sometimes go through\r\n",
      "their business with the zest of the daily bell-ringer. Mr. Wrench was a\r\n",
      "small, neat, bilious man, with a well-dressed wig: he had a laborious\r\n",
      "practice, an irascible temper, a lymphatic wife and seven children; and\r\n",
      "he was already rather late before setting out on a four-miles drive to\r\n",
      "meet Dr. Minchin on the other side of Tipton, the decease of Hicks, a\r\n",
      "rural practitioner, having increased Middlemarch practice in that\r\n",
      "direction. Great statesmen err, and why not small medical men? Mr.\r\n",
      "Wrench did not neglect sending the usual white parcels, which this time\r\n",
      "had black and drastic contents. Their effect was not alleviating to\r\n",
      "poor Fred, who, however, unwilling as he said to believe that he was\r\n",
      "“in for an illness,” rose at his usual easy hour the next morning and\r\n",
      "went down-stairs meaning to breakfast, but succeeded in nothing but in\r\n",
      "sitting and shivering by the fire. Mr. Wrench was again sent for, but\r\n",
      "was gone on his rounds, and Mrs. Vincy seeing her darling’s changed\r\n",
      "looks and general misery, began to cry and said she would send for Dr.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Mamma!” said Rosamond, who was seated near the window (the dining-room\r\n",

      "every one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Vincy sprang to the window and opened it in an instant, thinking\r\n",
      "only of Fred and not of medical etiquette. Lydgate was only two yards\r\n",
      "off on the other side of some iron palisading, and turned round at the\r\n",
      "sudden sound of the sash, before she called to him. In two minutes he\r\n",
      "was in the room, and Rosamond went out, after waiting just long enough\r\n",
      "to show a pretty anxiety conflicting with her sense of what was\r\n",
      "becoming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate had to hear a narrative in which Mrs. Vincy’s mind insisted\r\n",
      "with remarkable instinct on every point of minor importance, especially\r\n",
      "on what Mr. Wrench had said and had not said about coming again. That\r\n",
      "there might be an awkward affair with Wrench, Lydgate saw at once; but\r\n",
      "the case was serious enough to make him dismiss that consideration: he\r\n",
      "was convinced that Fred was in the pink-skinned stage of typhoid fever,\r\n",
      "and that he had taken just the wrong medicines. He must go to bed\r\n",
      "immediately, must have a regular nurse, and various appliances and\r\n",
      "precautions must be used, about which Lydgate was particular. Poor Mrs.\r\n",
      "Vincy’s terror at these indications of danger found vent in such words\r\n",
      "as came most easily. She thought it “very ill usage on the part of Mr.\r\n",
      "Wrench, who had attended their house so many years in preference to Mr.\r\n",
      "Peacock, though Mr. Peacock was equally a friend. Why Mr. Wrench should\r\n",
      "neglect her children more than others, she could not for the life of\r\n",
      "her understand. He had not neglected Mrs. Larcher’s when they had the\r\n",

      "anything should happen—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here poor Mrs. Vincy’s spirit quite broke down, and her Niobe throat\r\n",
      "and good-humored face were sadly convulsed. This was in the hall out of\r\n",
      "Fred’s hearing, but Rosamond had opened the drawing-room door, and now\r\n",
      "came forward anxiously. Lydgate apologized for Mr. Wrench, said that\r\n",
      "the symptoms yesterday might have been disguising, and that this form\r\n",
      "of fever was very equivocal in its beginnings: he would go immediately\r\n",
      "to the druggist’s and have a prescription made up in order to lose no\r\n",
      "time, but he would write to Mr. Wrench and tell him what had been done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you must come again—you must go on attending Fred. I can’t have my\r\n",
      "boy left to anybody who may come or not. I bear nobody ill-will, thank\r\n",
      "God, and Mr. Wrench saved me in the pleurisy, but he’d better have let\r\n",
      "me die—if—if—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will meet Mr. Wrench here, then, shall I?” said Lydgate, really\r\n",

      "of this kind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray make that arrangement, Mr. Lydgate,” said Rosamond, coming to her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When Mr. Vincy came home he was very angry with Wrench, and did not\r\n",
      "care if he never came into his house again. Lydgate should go on now,\r\n",
      "whether Wrench liked it or not. It was no joke to have fever in the\r\n",
      "house. Everybody must be sent to now, not to come to dinner on\r\n",
      "Thursday. And Pritchard needn’t get up any wine: brandy was the best\r\n",

      "emphatically—as much as to say, this was not an occasion for firing\r\n",
      "with blank-cartridges. “He’s an uncommonly unfortunate lad, is Fred.\r\n",
      "He’d need have some luck by and by to make up for all this—else I don’t\r\n",
      "know who’d have an eldest son.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t say so, Vincy,” said the mother, with a quivering lip, “if you\r\n",

      "“It will worret you to death, Lucy; _that_ I can see,” said Mr. Vincy,\r\n",
      "more mildly. “However, Wrench shall know what I think of the matter.”\r\n",

      "have been hindered if Wrench had shown the proper solicitude about\r\n",
      "his—the Mayor’s—family.) “I’m the last man to give in to the cry about\r\n",
      "new doctors, or new parsons either—whether they’re Bulstrode’s men or\r\n",
      "not. But Wrench shall know what I think, take it as he will.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wrench did not take it at all well. Lydgate was as polite as he could\r\n",

      "disadvantage is only an additional exasperation, especially if he\r\n",
      "happens to have been an object of dislike beforehand. Country\r\n",
      "practitioners used to be an irritable species, susceptible on the point\r\n",
      "of honor; and Mr. Wrench was one of the most irritable among them. He\r\n",
      "did not refuse to meet Lydgate in the evening, but his temper was\r\n",
      "somewhat tried on the occasion. He had to hear Mrs. Vincy say—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Mr. Wrench, what have I ever done that you should use me so?— To\r\n",
      "go away, and never to come again! And my boy might have been stretched\r\n",
      "a corpse!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy, who had been keeping up a sharp fire on the enemy Infection,\r\n",
      "and was a good deal heated in consequence, started up when he heard\r\n",
      "Wrench come in, and went into the hall to let him know what he thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll tell you what, Wrench, this is beyond a joke,” said the Mayor,\r\n",
      "who of late had had to rebuke offenders with an official air, and now\r\n",
      "broadened himself by putting his thumbs in his armholes. “To let fever\r\n",
      "get unawares into a house like this. There are some things that ought\r\n",
      "to be actionable, and are not so— that’s my opinion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But irrational reproaches were easier to bear than the sense of being\r\n",
      "instructed, or rather the sense that a younger man, like Lydgate,\r\n",
      "inwardly considered him in need of instruction, for “in point of fact,”\r\n",
      "Mr. Wrench afterwards said, Lydgate paraded flighty, foreign notions,\r\n",
      "which would not wear. He swallowed his ire for the moment, but he\r\n",
      "afterwards wrote to decline further attendance in the case. The house\r\n",
      "might be a good one, but Mr. Wrench was not going to truckle to anybody\r\n",
      "on a professional matter. He reflected, with much probability on his\r\n",
      "side, that Lydgate would by-and-by be caught tripping too, and that his\r\n",
      "ungentlemanly attempts to discredit the sale of drugs by his\r\n",
      "professional brethren, would by-and-by recoil on himself. He threw out\r\n",
      "biting remarks on Lydgate’s tricks, worthy only of a quack, to get\r\n",
      "himself a factitious reputation with credulous people. That cant about\r\n",
      "cures was never got up by sound practitioners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a point on which Lydgate smarted as much as Wrench could\r\n",
      "desire. To be puffed by ignorance was not only humiliating, but\r\n",
      "perilous, and not more enviable than the reputation of the\r\n",
      "weather-prophet. He was impatient of the foolish expectations amidst\r\n",
      "which all work must be carried on, and likely enough to damage himself\r\n",
      "as much as Mr. Wrench could wish, by an unprofessional openness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, Lydgate was installed as medical attendant on the Vincys, and\r\n",
      "the event was a subject of general conversation in Middlemarch. Some\r\n",
      "said, that the Vincys had behaved scandalously, that Mr. Vincy had\r\n",
      "threatened Wrench, and that Mrs. Vincy had accused him of poisoning her\r\n",
      "son. Others were of opinion that Mr. Lydgate’s passing by was\r\n",
      "providential, that he was wonderfully clever in fevers, and that\r\n",
      "Bulstrode was in the right to bring him forward. Many people believed\r\n",
      "that Lydgate’s coming to the town at all was really due to Bulstrode;\r\n",
      "and Mrs. Taft, who was always counting stitches and gathered her\r\n",
      "information in misleading fragments caught between the rows of her\r\n",
      "knitting, had got it into her head that Mr. Lydgate was a natural son\r\n",
      "of Bulstrode’s, a fact which seemed to justify her suspicions of\r\n",
      "evangelical laymen.\r\n",

      "sorry to think it of Mr. Lydgate.”\r\n",

      "bring her and Lydgate within effective proximity. It would have been to\r\n",
      "contravene these arrangements if Rosamond had consented to go away to\r\n",
      "Stone Court or elsewhere, as her parents wished her to do, especially\r\n",
      "since Mr. Lydgate thought the precaution needless. Therefore, while\r\n",
      "Miss Morgan and the children were sent away to a farmhouse the morning\r\n",
      "after Fred’s illness had declared itself, Rosamond refused to leave\r\n",
      "papa and mamma.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor mamma indeed was an object to touch any creature born of woman;\r\n",
      "and Mr. Vincy, who doted on his wife, was more alarmed on her account\r\n",
      "than on Fred’s. But for his insistence she would have taken no rest:\r\n",
      "her brightness was all bedimmed; unconscious of her costume which had\r\n",
      "always been so fresh and gay, she was like a sick bird with languid eye\r\n",
      "and plumage ruffled, her senses dulled to the sights and sounds that\r\n",
      "used most to interest her. Fred’s delirium, in which he seemed to be\r\n",
      "wandering out of her reach, tore her heart. After her first outburst\r\n",
      "against Mr. Wrench she went about very quietly: her one low cry was to\r\n",
      "Lydgate. She would follow him out of the room and put her hand on his\r\n",
      "arm moaning out, “Save my boy.” Once she pleaded, “He has always been\r\n",
      "good to me, Mr. Lydgate: he never had a hard word for his mother,”—as\r\n",
      "if poor Fred’s suffering were an accusation against him. All the\r\n",
      "deepest fibres of the mother’s memory were stirred, and the young man\r\n",
      "whose voice took a gentler tone when he spoke to her, was one with the\r\n",
      "babe whom she had loved, with a love new to her, before he was born.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have good hope, Mrs. Vincy,” Lydgate would say. “Come down with me\r\n",
      "and let us talk about the food.” In that way he led her to the parlor\r\n",
      "where Rosamond was, and made a change for her, surprising her into\r\n",
      "taking some tea or broth which had been prepared for her. There was a\r\n",
      "constant understanding between him and Rosamond on these matters. He\r\n",
      "almost always saw her before going to the sickroom, and she appealed to\r\n",
      "him as to what she could do for mamma. Her presence of mind and\r\n",
      "adroitness in carrying out his hints were admirable, and it is not\r\n",
      "wonderful that the idea of seeing Rosamond began to mingle itself with\r\n",
      "his interest in the case. Especially when the critical stage was\r\n",
      "passed, and he began to feel confident of Fred’s recovery. In the more\r\n",
      "doubtful time, he had advised calling in Dr. Sprague (who, if he could,\r\n",
      "would rather have remained neutral on Wrench’s account); but after two\r\n",
      "consultations, the conduct of the case was left to Lydgate, and there\r\n",
      "was every reason to make him assiduous. Morning and evening he was at\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy’s, and gradually the visits became cheerful as Fred became\r\n",
      "simply feeble, and lay not only in need of the utmost petting but\r\n",
      "conscious of it, so that Mrs. Vincy felt as if, after all, the illness\r\n",
      "had made a festival for her tenderness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both father and mother held it an added reason for good spirits, when\r\n",
      "old Mr. Featherstone sent messages by Lydgate, saying that Fred must\r\n",
      "make haste and get well, as he, Peter Featherstone, could not do\r\n",
      "without him, and missed his visits sadly. The old man himself was\r\n",
      "getting bedridden. Mrs. Vincy told these messages to Fred when he could\r\n",
      "listen, and he turned towards her his delicate, pinched face, from\r\n",
      "which all the thick blond hair had been cut away, and in which the eyes\r\n",
      "seemed to have got larger, yearning for some word about Mary—wondering\r\n",
      "what she felt about his illness. No word passed his lips; but “to hear\r\n",
      "with eyes belongs to love’s rare wit,” and the mother in the fulness of\r\n",
      "her heart not only divined Fred’s longing, but felt ready for any\r\n",
      "sacrifice in order to satisfy him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I can only see my boy strong again,” she said, in her loving folly;\r\n",
      "“and who knows?—perhaps master of Stone Court! and he can marry anybody\r\n",
      "he likes then.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not if they won’t have me, mother,” said Fred. The illness had made\r\n",
      "him childish, and tears came as he spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, take a bit of jelly, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, secretly\r\n",
      "incredulous of any such refusal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She never left Fred’s side when her husband was not in the house, and\r\n",
      "thus Rosamond was in the unusual position of being much alone. Lydgate,\r\n",
      "naturally, never thought of staying long with her, yet it seemed that\r\n",
      "the brief impersonal conversations they had together were creating that\r\n",
      "peculiar intimacy which consists in shyness. They were obliged to look\r\n",
      "at each other in speaking, and somehow the looking could not be carried\r\n",
      "through as the matter of course which it really was. Lydgate began to\r\n",
      "feel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and one day looked down, or\r\n",
      "anywhere, like an ill-worked puppet. But this turned out badly: the\r\n",
      "next day, Rosamond looked down, and the consequence was that when their\r\n",
      "eyes met again, both were more conscious than before. There was no help\r\n",
      "for this in science, and as Lydgate did not want to flirt, there seemed\r\n",
      "to be no help for it in folly. It was therefore a relief when neighbors\r\n",
      "no longer considered the house in quarantine, and when the chances of\r\n",
      "seeing Rosamond alone were very much reduced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But that intimacy of mutual embarrassment, in which each feels that the\r\n",
      "other is feeling something, having once existed, its effect is not to\r\n",
      "be done away with. Talk about the weather and other well-bred topics is\r\n",
      "apt to seem a hollow device, and behavior can hardly become easy unless\r\n",
      "it frankly recognizes a mutual fascination—which of course need not\r\n",
      "mean anything deep or serious. This was the way in which Rosamond and\r\n",
      "Lydgate slid gracefully into ease, and made their intercourse lively\r\n",
      "again. Visitors came and went as usual, there was once more music in\r\n",
      "the drawing-room, and all the extra hospitality of Mr. Vincy’s\r\n",
      "mayoralty returned. Lydgate, whenever he could, took his seat by\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s side, and lingered to hear her music, calling himself her\r\n",
      "captive—meaning, all the while, not to be her captive. The\r\n",
      "preposterousness of the notion that he could at once set up a\r\n",
      "satisfactory establishment as a married man was a sufficient guarantee\r\n",
      "against danger. This play at being a little in love was agreeable, and\r\n",
      "did not interfere with graver pursuits. Flirtation, after all, was not\r\n",
      "necessarily a singeing process. Rosamond, for her part, had never\r\n",
      "enjoyed the days so much in her life before: she was sure of being\r\n",
      "admired by some one worth captivating, and she did not distinguish\r\n",
      "flirtation from love, either in herself or in another. She seemed to be\r\n",
      "sailing with a fair wind just whither she would go, and her thoughts\r\n",
      "were much occupied with a handsome house in Lowick Gate which she hoped\r\n",
      "would by-and-by be vacant. She was quite determined, when she was\r\n",
      "married, to rid herself adroitly of all the visitors who were not\r\n",
      "agreeable to her at her father’s; and she imagined the drawing-room in\r\n",
      "her favorite house with various styles of furniture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certainly her thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself; he\r\n",
      "seemed to her almost perfect: if he had known his notes so that his\r\n",
      "enchantment under her music had been less like an emotional elephant’s,\r\n",
      "and if he had been able to discriminate better the refinements of her\r\n",
      "taste in dress, she could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in him.\r\n",
      "How different he was from young Plymdale or Mr. Caius Larcher! Those\r\n",
      "young men had not a notion of French, and could speak on no subject\r\n",
      "with striking knowledge, except perhaps the dyeing and carrying trades,\r\n",
      "which of course they were ashamed to mention; they were Middlemarch\r\n",
      "gentry, elated with their silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but\r\n",
      "embarrassed in their manners, and timidly jocose: even Fred was above\r\n",
      "them, having at least the accent and manner of a university man.\r\n",
      "Whereas Lydgate was always listened to, bore himself with the careless\r\n",
      "politeness of conscious superiority, and seemed to have the right\r\n",
      "clothes on by a certain natural affinity, without ever having to think\r\n",
      "about them. Rosamond was proud when he entered the room, and when he\r\n",
      "approached her with a distinguishing smile, she had a delicious sense\r\n",
      "that she was the object of enviable homage. If Lydgate had been aware\r\n",
      "of all the pride he excited in that delicate bosom, he might have been\r\n",
      "just as well pleased as any other man, even the most densely ignorant\r\n",
      "of humoral pathology or fibrous tissue: he held it one of the prettiest\r\n",
      "attitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man’s pre-eminence without\r\n",
      "too precise a knowledge of what it consisted in. But Rosamond was not\r\n",
      "one of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares, and whose\r\n",
      "behavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses, instead of being\r\n",
      "steered by wary grace and propriety. Do you imagine that her rapid\r\n",
      "forecast and rumination concerning house-furniture and society were\r\n",
      "ever discernible in her conversation, even with her mamma? On the\r\n",
      "contrary, she would have expressed the prettiest surprise and\r\n",
      "disapprobation if she had heard that another young lady had been\r\n",
      "detected in that immodest prematureness—indeed, would probably have\r\n",
      "disbelieved in its possibility. For Rosamond never showed any\r\n",
      "unbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct\r\n",
      "sentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private\r\n",
      "album for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the\r\n",
      "irresistible woman for the doomed man of that date. Think no unfair\r\n",
      "evil of her, pray: she had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or\r\n",
      "mercenary; in fact, she never thought of money except as something\r\n",
      "necessary which other people would always provide. She was not in the\r\n",
      "habit of devising falsehoods, and if her statements were no direct clew\r\n",
      "to fact, why, they were not intended in that light—they were among her\r\n",
      "elegant accomplishments, intended to please. Nature had inspired many\r\n",
      "arts in finishing Mrs. Lemon’s favorite pupil, who by general consent\r\n",
      "(Fred’s excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness, and\r\n",
      "amiability.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate found it more and more agreeable to be with her, and there was\r\n",
      "no constraint now, there was a delightful interchange of influence in\r\n",
      "their eyes, and what they said had that superfluity of meaning for\r\n",
      "them, which is observable with some sense of flatness by a third\r\n",
      "person; still they had no interviews or asides from which a third\r\n",
      "person need have been excluded. In fact, they flirted; and Lydgate was\r\n",
      "secure in the belief that they did nothing else. If a man could not\r\n",
      "love and be wise, surely he could flirt and be wise at the same time?\r\n",
      "Really, the men in Middlemarch, except Mr. Farebrother, were great\r\n",
      "bores, and Lydgate did not care about commercial politics or cards:\r\n",
      "what was he to do for relaxation? He was often invited to the\r\n",
      "Bulstrodes’; but the girls there were hardly out of the schoolroom; and\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bulstrode’s _naive_ way of conciliating piety and worldliness, the\r\n",
      "nothingness of this life and the desirability of cut glass, the\r\n",
      "consciousness at once of filthy rags and the best damask, was not a\r\n",
      "sufficient relief from the weight of her husband’s invariable\r\n",
      "seriousness. The Vincys’ house, with all its faults, was the pleasanter\r\n",
      "by contrast; besides, it nourished Rosamond—sweet to look at as a\r\n",
      "half-opened blush-rose, and adorned with accomplishments for the\r\n",
      "refined amusement of man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he made some enemies, other than medical, by his success with Miss\r\n",
      "Vincy. One evening he came into the drawing-room rather late, when\r\n",
      "several other visitors were there. The card-table had drawn off the\r\n",
      "elders, and Mr. Ned Plymdale (one of the good matches in Middlemarch,\r\n",
      "though not one of its leading minds) was in _tête-à-tête_ with\r\n",
      "Rosamond. He had brought the last “Keepsake,” the gorgeous watered-silk\r\n",
      "publication which marked modern progress at that time; and he\r\n",
      "considered himself very fortunate that he could be the first to look\r\n",
      "over it with her, dwelling on the ladies and gentlemen with shiny\r\n",
      "copper-plate cheeks and copper-plate smiles, and pointing to comic\r\n",
      "verses as capital and sentimental stories as interesting. Rosamond was\r\n",
      "gracious, and Mr. Ned was satisfied that he had the very best thing in\r\n",
      "art and literature as a medium for “paying addresses”—the very thing to\r\n",
      "please a nice girl. He had also reasons, deep rather than ostensible,\r\n",
      "for being satisfied with his own appearance. To superficial observers\r\n",
      "his chin had too vanishing an aspect, looking as if it were being\r\n",
      "gradually reabsorbed. And it did indeed cause him some difficulty about\r\n",
      "the fit of his satin stocks, for which chins were at that time useful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think the Honorable Mrs. S. is something like you,” said Mr. Ned. He\r\n",
      "kept the book open at the bewitching portrait, and looked at it rather\r\n",
      "languishingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Her back is very large; she seems to have sat for that,” said\r\n",
      "Rosamond, not meaning any satire, but thinking how red young Plymdale’s\r\n",
      "hands were, and wondering why Lydgate did not come. She went on with\r\n",
      "her tatting all the while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not say she was as beautiful as you are,” said Mr. Ned,\r\n",
      "venturing to look from the portrait to its rival.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suspect you of being an adroit flatterer,” said Rosamond, feeling\r\n",
      "sure that she should have to reject this young gentleman a second time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But now Lydgate came in; the book was closed before he reached\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s corner, and as he took his seat with easy confidence on the\r\n",
      "other side of her, young Plymdale’s jaw fell like a barometer towards\r\n",
      "the cheerless side of change. Rosamond enjoyed not only Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "presence but its effect: she liked to excite jealousy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a late comer you are!” she said, as they shook hands. “Mamma had\r\n",
      "given you up a little while ago. How do you find Fred?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As usual; going on well, but slowly. I want him to go away—to Stone\r\n",
      "Court, for example. But your mamma seems to have some objection.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor fellow!” said Rosamond, prettily. “You will see Fred so changed,”\r\n",
      "she added, turning to the other suitor; “we have looked to Mr. Lydgate\r\n",
      "as our guardian angel during this illness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the “Keepsake” towards\r\n",
      "him and opening it, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up his chin,\r\n",
      "as if in wonderment at human folly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you laughing at so profanely?” said Rosamond, with bland\r\n",
      "neutrality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wonder which would turn out to be the silliest—the engravings or the\r\n",
      "writing here,” said Lydgate, in his most convinced tone, while he\r\n",
      "turned over the pages quickly, seeming to see all through the book in\r\n",
      "no time, and showing his large white hands to much advantage, as\r\n",
      "Rosamond thought. “Do look at this bridegroom coming out of church: did\r\n",
      "you ever see such a ‘sugared invention’—as the Elizabethans used to\r\n",
      "say? Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking? Yet I will answer for\r\n",
      "it the story makes him one of the first gentlemen in the land.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are so severe, I am frightened at you,” said Rosamond, keeping her\r\n",
      "amusement duly moderate. Poor young Plymdale had lingered with\r\n",
      "admiration over this very engraving, and his spirit was stirred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There are a great many celebrated people writing in the ‘Keepsake,’ at\r\n",
      "all events,” he said, in a tone at once piqued and timid. “This is the\r\n",
      "first time I have heard it called silly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think I shall turn round on you and accuse you of being a Goth,”\r\n",
      "said Rosamond, looking at Lydgate with a smile. “I suspect you know\r\n",
      "nothing about Lady Blessington and L. E. L.” Rosamond herself was not\r\n",
      "without relish for these writers, but she did not readily commit\r\n",
      "herself by admiration, and was alive to the slightest hint that\r\n",
      "anything was not, according to Lydgate, in the very highest taste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But Sir Walter Scott—I suppose Mr. Lydgate knows him,” said young\r\n",
      "Plymdale, a little cheered by this advantage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I read no literature now,” said Lydgate, shutting the book, and\r\n",
      "pushing it away. “I read so much when I was a lad, that I suppose it\r\n",
      "will last me all my life. I used to know Scott’s poems by heart.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should like to know when you left off,” said Rosamond, “because then\r\n",
      "I might be sure that I knew something which you did not know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Lydgate would say that was not worth knowing,” said Mr. Ned,\r\n",
      "purposely caustic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“On the contrary,” said Lydgate, showing no smart; but smiling with\r\n",
      "exasperating confidence at Rosamond. “It would be worth knowing by the\r\n",
      "fact that Miss Vincy could tell it me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Young Plymdale soon went to look at the whist-playing, thinking that\r\n",
      "Lydgate was one of the most conceited, unpleasant fellows it had ever\r\n",
      "been his ill-fortune to meet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How rash you are!” said Rosamond, inwardly delighted. “Do you see that\r\n",
      "you have given offence?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! is it Mr. Plymdale’s book? I am sorry. I didn’t think about it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall begin to admit what you said of yourself when you first came\r\n",
      "here—that you are a bear, and want teaching by the birds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, there is a bird who can teach me what she will. Don’t I listen\r\n",
      "to her willingly?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To Rosamond it seemed as if she and Lydgate were as good as engaged.\r\n",
      "That they were some time to be engaged had long been an idea in her\r\n",
      "mind; and ideas, we know, tend to a more solid kind of existence, the\r\n",
      "necessary materials being at hand. It is true, Lydgate had the\r\n",
      "counter-idea of remaining unengaged; but this was a mere negative, a\r\n",
      "shadow cast by other resolves which themselves were capable of\r\n",
      "shrinking. Circumstance was almost sure to be on the side of Rosamond’s\r\n",
      "idea, which had a shaping activity and looked through watchful blue\r\n",
      "eyes, whereas Lydgate’s lay blind and unconcerned as a jelly-fish which\r\n",
      "gets melted without knowing it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That evening when he went home, he looked at his phials to see how a\r\n",
      "process of maceration was going on, with undisturbed interest; and he\r\n",
      "wrote out his daily notes with as much precision as usual. The reveries\r\n",
      "from which it was difficult for him to detach himself were ideal\r\n",
      "constructions of something else than Rosamond’s virtues, and the\r\n",
      "primitive tissue was still his fair unknown. Moreover, he was beginning\r\n",
      "to feel some zest for the growing though half-suppressed feud between\r\n",
      "him and the other medical men, which was likely to become more\r\n",
      "manifest, now that Bulstrode’s method of managing the new hospital was\r\n",
      "about to be declared; and there were various inspiriting signs that his\r\n",
      "non-acceptance by some of Peacock’s patients might be counterbalanced\r\n",
      "by the impression he had produced in other quarters. Only a few days\r\n",
      "later, when he had happened to overtake Rosamond on the Lowick road and\r\n",

      "wind about her neck and cling down her blue-gray pelisse with a\r\n",
      "tenderness gathered from her own, a sentient commingled innocence which\r\n",

      "continuance of that transitional life understood to correspond with the\r\n",
      "excitement of bridal felicity, and keeping up the sense of busy\r\n",
      "ineffectiveness, as of a dream which the dreamer begins to suspect. The\r\n",
      "duties of her married life, contemplated as so great beforehand, seemed\r\n",

      "into uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment. When would the\r\n",
      "days begin of that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen her\r\n",
      "husband’s life and exalt her own? Never perhaps, as she had\r\n",

      "please, my dear:” that had been her brief history since she had left\r\n",
      "off learning morning lessons and practising silly rhythms on the hated\r\n",
      "piano. Marriage, which was to bring guidance into worthy and imperative\r\n",
      "occupation, had not yet freed her from the gentlewoman’s oppressive\r\n",

      "living in her mind when she first saw this room nearly three months\r\n",
      "before were present now only as memories: she judged them as we judge\r\n",
      "transient and departed things. All existence seemed to beat with a\r\n",

      "shrinking away from her. Each remembered thing in the room was\r\n",
      "disenchanted, was deadened as an unlit transparency, till her wandering\r\n",
      "gaze came to the group of miniatures, and there at last she saw\r\n",
      "something which had gathered new breath and meaning: it was the\r\n",
      "miniature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt Julia, who had made the unfortunate\r\n",
      "marriage—of Will Ladislaw’s grandmother. Dorothea could fancy that it\r\n",
      "was alive now—the delicate woman’s face which yet had a headstrong\r\n",
      "look, a peculiarity difficult to interpret. Was it only her friends who\r\n",
      "thought her marriage unfortunate? or did she herself find it out to be\r\n",
      "a mistake, and taste the salt bitterness of her tears in the merciful\r\n",
      "silence of the night? What breadths of experience Dorothea seemed to\r\n",
      "have passed over since she first looked at this miniature! She felt a\r\n",
      "new companionship with it, as if it had an ear for her and could see\r\n",
      "how she was looking at it. Here was a woman who had known some\r\n",
      "difficulty about marriage. Nay, the colors deepened, the lips and chin\r\n",
      "seemed to get larger, the hair and eyes seemed to be sending out light,\r\n",
      "the face was masculine and beamed on her with that full gaze which\r\n",
      "tells her on whom it falls that she is too interesting for the\r\n",
      "slightest movement of her eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted.\r\n",
      "The vivid presentation came like a pleasant glow to Dorothea: she felt\r\n",
      "herself smiling, and turning from the miniature sat down and looked up\r\n",
      "as if she were again talking to a figure in front of her. But the smile\r\n",
      "disappeared as she went on meditating, and at last she said aloud—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, it was cruel to speak so! How sad—how dreadful!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She rose quickly and went out of the room, hurrying along the corridor,\r\n",
      "with the irresistible impulse to go and see her husband and inquire if\r\n",
      "she could do anything for him. Perhaps Mr. Tucker was gone and Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon was alone in the library. She felt as if all her morning’s\r\n",

      "presence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when she reached the head of the dark oak there was Celia coming\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Dodo!” said Celia, in her quiet staccato; then kissed her sister,\r\n",

      "little in a furtive manner, while Dorothea ran down-stairs to greet her\r\n",
      "uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I need not ask how you are, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, after kissing\r\n",
      "her forehead. “Rome has agreed with you, I see—happiness, frescos, the\r\n",
      "antique—that sort of thing. Well, it’s very pleasant to have you back\r\n",
      "again, and you understand all about art now, eh? But Casaubon is a\r\n",
      "little pale, I tell him—a little pale, you know. Studying hard in his\r\n",
      "holidays is carrying it rather too far. I overdid it at one time”—Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke still held Dorothea’s hand, but had turned his face to Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon—“about topography, ruins, temples—I thought I had a clew, but\r\n",
      "I saw it would carry me too far, and nothing might come of it. You may\r\n",
      "go any length in that sort of thing, and nothing may come of it, you\r\n",
      "know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s eyes also were turned up to her husband’s face with some\r\n",
      "anxiety at the idea that those who saw him afresh after absence might\r\n",
      "be aware of signs which she had not noticed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing to alarm you, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, observing her\r\n",
      "expression. “A little English beef and mutton will soon make a\r\n",
      "difference. It was all very well to look pale, sitting for the portrait\r\n",
      "of Aquinas, you know—we got your letter just in time. But Aquinas,\r\n",
      "now—he was a little too subtle, wasn’t he? Does anybody read Aquinas?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is not indeed an author adapted to superficial minds,” said Mr.\r\n",

      "to the rescue.\r\n",

      "topics.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you think it nice to go to Rome on a wedding journey?” said Celia,\r\n",

      "smallest occasions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would not suit all—not you, dear, for example,” said Dorothea,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "better, because more educable and submissive—of a rank equal to his\r\n",

      "dimmer and that he felt lonely, was a reason to him for losing no more\r\n",

      "Casaubon was nervously conscious that he was expected to manifest a\r\n",
      "powerful mind.) Providence, in its kindness, had supplied him with the\r\n",
      "wife he needed. A wife, a modest young lady, with the purely\r\n",

      "He had not had much foretaste of happiness in his previous life. To\r\n",

      "of its wings and never flying. His experience was of that pitiable kind\r\n",
      "which shrinks from pity, and fears most of all that it should be known:\r\n",
      "it was that proud narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough to\r\n",
      "spare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers thread-like in\r\n",
      "small currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic\r\n",
      "scrupulosity. And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples: he was capable of a\r\n",
      "severe self-restraint; he was resolute in being a man of honor\r\n",
      "according to the code; he would be unimpeachable by any recognized\r\n",
      "opinion. In conduct these ends had been attained; but the difficulty of\r\n",
      "making his Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead upon\r\n",
      "his mind; and the pamphlets—or “Parerga” as he called them—by which he\r\n",
      "tested his public and deposited small monumental records of his march,\r\n",
      "were far from having been seen in all their significance. He suspected\r\n",

      "what was really thought of them by the leading minds of Brasenose, and\r\n",
      "bitterly convinced that his old acquaintance Carp had been the writer\r\n",
      "of that depreciatory recension which was kept locked in a small drawer\r\n",
      "of Mr. Casaubon’s desk, and also in a dark closet of his verbal memory.\r\n",

      "own authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope in\r\n",
      "immortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten\r\n",
      "Key to all Mythologies. For my part I am very sorry for him. It is an\r\n",
      "uneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to\r\n",
      "enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be\r\n",
      "liberated from a small hungry shivering self—never to be fully\r\n",
      "possessed by the glory we behold, never to have our consciousness\r\n",
      "rapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a\r\n",
      "passion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and\r\n",
      "uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dim-sighted. Becoming a\r\n",
      "dean or even a bishop would make little difference, I fear, to Mr.\r\n",

      "predominate over any other satisfaction. Marriage, like religion and\r\n",
      "erudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward\r\n",
      "requirement, and Edward Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably\r\n",

      "according to his own intention before marriage, was an effort which he\r\n",
      "was always tempted to defer, and but for her pleading insistence it\r\n",
      "might never have begun. But she had succeeded in making it a matter of\r\n",
      "course that she should take her place at an early hour in the library\r\n",
      "and have work either of reading aloud or copying assigned her. The work\r\n",
      "had been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an immediate\r\n",
      "intention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small monograph on some\r\n",
      "lately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries whereby\r\n",
      "certain assertions of Warburton’s could be corrected. References were\r\n",
      "extensive even here, but not altogether shoreless; and sentences were\r\n",
      "actually to be written in the shape wherein they would be scanned by\r\n",
      "Brasenose and a less formidable posterity. These minor monumental\r\n",
      "productions were always exciting to Mr. Casaubon; digestion was made\r\n",
      "difficult by the interference of citations, or by the rivalry of\r\n",
      "dialectical phrases ringing against each other in his brain. And from\r\n",
      "the first there was to be a Latin dedication about which everything was\r\n",
      "uncertain except that it was not to be addressed to Carp: it was a\r\n",
      "poisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that he had once addressed a\r\n",
      "dedication to Carp in which he had numbered that member of the animal\r\n",
      "kingdom among the _viros nullo ævo perituros_, a mistake which would\r\n",
      "infallibly lay the dedicator open to ridicule in the next age, and\r\n",
      "might even be chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus Mr. Casaubon was in one of his busiest epochs, and as I began to\r\n",
      "say a little while ago, Dorothea joined him early in the library where\r\n",
      "he had breakfasted alone. Celia at this time was on a second visit to\r\n",
      "Lowick, probably the last before her marriage, and was in the\r\n",
      "drawing-room expecting Sir James.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea had learned to read the signs of her husband’s mood, and she\r\n",
      "saw that the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour.\r\n",
      "She was going silently to her desk when he said, in that distant tone\r\n",
      "which implied that he was discharging a disagreeable duty—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea, here is a letter for you, which was enclosed in one\r\n",
      "addressed to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a letter of two pages, and she immediately looked at the\r\n",
      "signature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Ladislaw! What can he have to say to me?” she exclaimed, in a tone\r\n",
      "of pleased surprise. “But,” she added, looking at Mr. Casaubon, “I can\r\n",
      "imagine what he has written to you about.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can, if you please, read the letter,” said Mr. Casaubon, severely\r\n",
      "pointing to it with his pen, and not looking at her. “But I may as well\r\n",
      "say beforehand, that I must decline the proposal it contains to pay a\r\n",
      "visit here. I trust I may be excused for desiring an interval of\r\n",
      "complete freedom from such distractions as have been hitherto\r\n",
      "inevitable, and especially from guests whose desultory vivacity makes\r\n",
      "their presence a fatigue.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There had been no clashing of temper between Dorothea and her husband\r\n",
      "since that little explosion in Rome, which had left such strong traces\r\n",
      "in her mind that it had been easier ever since to quell emotion than to\r\n",
      "incur the consequence of venting it. But this ill-tempered anticipation\r\n",
      "that she could desire visits which might be disagreeable to her\r\n",
      "husband, this gratuitous defence of himself against selfish complaint\r\n",
      "on her part, was too sharp a sting to be meditated on until after it\r\n",
      "had been resented. Dorothea had thought that she could have been\r\n",
      "patient with John Milton, but she had never imagined him behaving in\r\n",
      "this way; and for a moment Mr. Casaubon seemed to be stupidly\r\n",
      "undiscerning and odiously unjust. Pity, that “new-born babe” which was\r\n",
      "by-and-by to rule many a storm within her, did not “stride the blast”\r\n",
      "on this occasion. With her first words, uttered in a tone that shook\r\n",
      "him, she startled Mr. Casaubon into looking at her, and meeting the\r\n",
      "flash of her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy you?\r\n",

      "at least till I appear to consult my own pleasure apart from yours.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea, you are hasty,” answered Mr. Casaubon, nervously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Decidedly, this woman was too young to be on the formidable level of\r\n",
      "wifehood—unless she had been pale and featureless and taken everything\r\n",
      "for granted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think it was you who were first hasty in your false suppositions\r\n",
      "about my feeling,” said Dorothea, in the same tone. The fire was not\r\n",
      "dissipated yet, and she thought it was ignoble in her husband not to\r\n",
      "apologize to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Here Mr. Casaubon dipped his pen and made as if he would return to his\r\n",
      "writing, though his hand trembled so much that the words seemed to be\r\n",
      "written in an unknown character. There are answers which, in turning\r\n",
      "away wrath, only send it to the other end of the room, and to have a\r\n",
      "discussion coolly waived when you feel that justice is all on your own\r\n",
      "side is even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea left Ladislaw’s two letters unread on her husband’s\r\n",
      "writing-table and went to her own place, the scorn and indignation\r\n",
      "within her rejecting the reading of these letters, just as we hurl away\r\n",
      "any trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean\r\n",
      "cupidity. She did not in the least divine the subtle sources of her\r\n",
      "husband’s bad temper about these letters: she only knew that they had\r\n",
      "caused him to offend her. She began to work at once, and her hand did\r\n",
      "not tremble; on the contrary, in writing out the quotations which had\r\n",
      "been given to her the day before, she felt that she was forming her\r\n",
      "letters beautifully, and it seemed to her that she saw the construction\r\n",
      "of the Latin she was copying, and which she was beginning to\r\n",
      "understand, more clearly than usual. In her indignation there was a\r\n",
      "sense of superiority, but it went out for the present in firmness of\r\n",
      "stroke, and did not compress itself into an inward articulate voice\r\n",
      "pronouncing the once “affable archangel” a poor creature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There had been this apparent quiet for half an hour, and Dorothea had\r\n",
      "not looked away from her own table, when she heard the loud bang of a\r\n",
      "book on the floor, and turning quickly saw Mr. Casaubon on the library\r\n",
      "steps clinging forward as if he were in some bodily distress. She\r\n",
      "started up and bounded towards him in an instant: he was evidently in\r\n",
      "great straits for breath. Jumping on a stool she got close to his elbow\r\n",
      "and said with her whole soul melted into tender alarm—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can you lean on me, dear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was still for two or three minutes, which seemed endless to her,\r\n",
      "unable to speak or move, gasping for breath. When at last he descended\r\n",
      "the three steps and fell backward in the large chair which Dorothea had\r\n",
      "drawn close to the foot of the ladder, he no longer gasped but seemed\r\n",
      "helpless and about to faint. Dorothea rang the bell violently, and\r\n",
      "presently Mr. Casaubon was helped to the couch: he did not faint, and\r\n",
      "was gradually reviving, when Sir James Chettam came in, having been met\r\n",
      "in the hall with the news that Mr. Casaubon had “had a fit in the\r\n",
      "library.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good God! this is just what might have been expected,” was his\r\n",
      "immediate thought. If his prophetic soul had been urged to\r\n",
      "particularize, it seemed to him that “fits” would have been the\r\n",
      "definite expression alighted upon. He asked his informant, the butler,\r\n",
      "whether the doctor had been sent for. The butler never knew his master\r\n",
      "to want the doctor before; but would it not be right to send for a\r\n",
      "physician?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Sir James entered the library, however, Mr. Casaubon could make\r\n",
      "some signs of his usual politeness, and Dorothea, who in the reaction\r\n",
      "from her first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by his side now\r\n",
      "rose and herself proposed that some one should ride off for a medical\r\n",
      "man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I recommend you to send for Lydgate,” said Sir James. “My mother has\r\n",
      "called him in, and she has found him uncommonly clever. She has had a\r\n",
      "poor opinion of the physicians since my father’s death.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea appealed to her husband, and he made a silent sign of\r\n",
      "approval. So Mr. Lydgate was sent for and he came wonderfully soon, for\r\n",
      "the messenger, who was Sir James Chettam’s man and knew Mr. Lydgate,\r\n",
      "met him leading his horse along the Lowick road and giving his arm to\r\n",
      "Miss Vincy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia, in the drawing-room, had known nothing of the trouble till Sir\r\n",
      "James told her of it. After Dorothea’s account, he no longer considered\r\n",
      "the illness a fit, but still something “of that nature.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor dear Dodo—how dreadful!” said Celia, feeling as much grieved as\r\n",
      "her own perfect happiness would allow. Her little hands were clasped,\r\n",
      "and enclosed by Sir James’s as a bud is enfolded by a liberal calyx.\r\n",
      "“It is very shocking that Mr. Casaubon should be ill; but I never did\r\n",
      "like him. And I think he is not half fond enough of Dorothea; and he\r\n",
      "ought to be, for I am sure no one else would have had him—do you think\r\n",
      "they would?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I always thought it a horrible sacrifice of your sister,” said Sir\r\n",
      "James.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes. But poor Dodo never did do what other people do, and I think she\r\n",
      "never will.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is a noble creature,” said the loyal-hearted Sir James. He had\r\n",
      "just had a fresh impression of this kind, as he had seen Dorothea\r\n",
      "stretching her tender arm under her husband’s neck and looking at him\r\n",
      "with unspeakable sorrow. He did not know how much penitence there was\r\n",
      "in the sorrow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Celia, thinking it was very well for Sir James to say so,\r\n",
      "but _he_ would not have been comfortable with Dodo. “Shall I go to her?\r\n",
      "Could I help her, do you think?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think it would be well for you just to go and see her before Lydgate\r\n",
      "comes,” said Sir James, magnanimously. “Only don’t stay long.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While Celia was gone he walked up and down remembering what he had\r\n",
      "originally felt about Dorothea’s engagement, and feeling a revival of\r\n",
      "his disgust at Mr. Brooke’s indifference. If Cadwallader—if every one\r\n",
      "else had regarded the affair as he, Sir James, had done, the marriage\r\n",
      "might have been hindered. It was wicked to let a young girl blindly\r\n",
      "decide her fate in that way, without any effort to save her. Sir James\r\n",
      "had long ceased to have any regrets on his own account: his heart was\r\n",
      "satisfied with his engagement to Celia. But he had a chivalrous nature\r\n",
      "(was not the disinterested service of woman among the ideal glories of\r\n",
      "old chivalry?): his disregarded love had not turned to bitterness; its\r\n",
      "death had made sweet odors—floating memories that clung with a\r\n",
      "consecrating effect to Dorothea. He could remain her brotherly friend,\r\n",

      "Mr. Casaubon had no second attack of equal severity with the first, and\r\n",
      "in a few days began to recover his usual condition. But Lydgate seemed\r\n",
      "to think the case worth a great deal of attention. He not only used his\r\n",
      "stethoscope (which had not become a matter of course in practice at\r\n",
      "that time), but sat quietly by his patient and watched him. To Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s questions about himself, he replied that the source of the\r\n",
      "illness was the common error of intellectual men—a too eager and\r\n",
      "monotonous application: the remedy was, to be satisfied with moderate\r\n",
      "work, and to seek variety of relaxation. Mr. Brooke, who sat by on one\r\n",
      "occasion, suggested that Mr. Casaubon should go fishing, as Cadwallader\r\n",
      "did, and have a turning-room, make toys, table-legs, and that kind of\r\n",

      "things,” he added, looking at Lydgate, “would be to me such relaxation\r\n",
      "as tow-picking is to prisoners in a house of correction.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I confess,” said Lydgate, smiling, “amusement is rather an\r\n",
      "unsatisfactory prescription. It is something like telling people to\r\n",
      "keep up their spirits. Perhaps I had better say, that you must submit\r\n",
      "to be mildly bored rather than to go on working.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "in the evenings. And shuttlecock, now—I don’t know a finer game than\r\n",
      "shuttlecock for the daytime. I remember it all the fashion. To be sure,\r\n",
      "your eyes might not stand that, Casaubon. But you must unbend, you\r\n",
      "know. Why, you might take to some light study: conchology, now: I\r\n",
      "always think that must be a light study. Or get Dorothea to read you\r\n",
      "light things, Smollett—‘Roderick Random,’ ‘Humphrey Clinker:’ they are\r\n",
      "a little broad, but she may read anything now she’s married, you know.\r\n",
      "I remember they made me laugh uncommonly—there’s a droll bit about a\r\n",

      "all these things, but they might be rather new to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As new as eating thistles,” would have been an answer to represent Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s feelings. But he only bowed resignedly, with due respect to\r\n",
      "his wife’s uncle, and observed that doubtless the works he mentioned\r\n",
      "had “served as a resource to a certain order of minds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see,” said the able magistrate to Lydgate, when they were outside\r\n",
      "the door, “Casaubon has been a little narrow: it leaves him rather at a\r\n",
      "loss when you forbid him his particular work, which I believe is\r\n",
      "something very deep indeed—in the line of research, you know. I would\r\n",
      "never give way to that; I was always versatile. But a clergyman is tied\r\n",
      "a little tight. If they would make him a bishop, now!—he did a very\r\n",
      "good pamphlet for Peel. He would have more movement then, more show; he\r\n",
      "might get a little flesh. But I recommend you to talk to Mrs. Casaubon.\r\n",

      "Without Mr. Brooke’s advice, Lydgate had determined on speaking to\r\n",
      "Dorothea. She had not been present while her uncle was throwing out his\r\n",
      "pleasant suggestions as to the mode in which life at Lowick might be\r\n",
      "enlivened, but she was usually by her husband’s side, and the\r\n",
      "unaffected signs of intense anxiety in her face and voice about\r\n",
      "whatever touched his mind or health, made a drama which Lydgate was\r\n",
      "inclined to watch. He said to himself that he was only doing right in\r\n",
      "telling her the truth about her husband’s probable future, but he\r\n",
      "certainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk\r\n",
      "confidentially with her. A medical man likes to make psychological\r\n",
      "observations, and sometimes in the pursuit of such studies is too\r\n",
      "easily tempted into momentous prophecy which life and death easily set\r\n",
      "at nought. Lydgate had often been satirical on this gratuitous\r\n",
      "prediction, and he meant now to be guarded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He asked for Mrs. Casaubon, but being told that she was out walking, he\r\n",
      "was going away, when Dorothea and Celia appeared, both glowing from\r\n",
      "their struggle with the March wind. When Lydgate begged to speak with\r\n",
      "her alone, Dorothea opened the library door which happened to be the\r\n",
      "nearest, thinking of nothing at the moment but what he might have to\r\n",
      "say about Mr. Casaubon. It was the first time she had entered this room\r\n",
      "since her husband had been taken ill, and the servant had chosen not to\r\n",
      "open the shutters. But there was light enough to read by from the\r\n",
      "narrow upper panes of the windows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will not mind this sombre light,” said Dorothea, standing in the\r\n",
      "middle of the room. “Since you forbade books, the library has been out\r\n",
      "of the question. But Mr. Casaubon will soon be here again, I hope. Is\r\n",
      "he not making progress?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, much more rapid progress than I at first expected. Indeed, he is\r\n",
      "already nearly in his usual state of health.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You do not fear that the illness will return?” said Dorothea, whose\r\n",
      "quick ear had detected some significance in Lydgate’s tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Such cases are peculiarly difficult to pronounce upon,” said Lydgate.\r\n",
      "“The only point on which I can be confident is that it will be\r\n",
      "desirable to be very watchful on Mr. Casaubon’s account, lest he should\r\n",
      "in any way strain his nervous power.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I beseech you to speak quite plainly,” said Dorothea, in an imploring\r\n",
      "tone. “I cannot bear to think that there might be something which I did\r\n",
      "not know, and which, if I had known it, would have made me act\r\n",
      "differently.” The words came out like a cry: it was evident that they\r\n",
      "were the voice of some mental experience which lay not very far off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sit down,” she added, placing herself on the nearest chair, and\r\n",
      "throwing off her bonnet and gloves, with an instinctive discarding of\r\n",
      "formality where a great question of destiny was concerned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What you say now justifies my own view,” said Lydgate. “I think it is\r\n",
      "one’s function as a medical man to hinder regrets of that sort as far\r\n",
      "as possible. But I beg you to observe that Mr. Casaubon’s case is\r\n",
      "precisely of the kind in which the issue is most difficult to pronounce\r\n",
      "upon. He may possibly live for fifteen years or more, without much\r\n",
      "worse health than he has had hitherto.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea had turned very pale, and when Lydgate paused she said in a\r\n",
      "low voice, “You mean if we are very careful.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes—careful against mental agitation of all kinds, and against\r\n",
      "excessive application.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He would be miserable, if he had to give up his work,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "with a quick prevision of that wretchedness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am aware of that. The only course is to try by all means, direct and\r\n",
      "indirect, to moderate and vary his occupations. With a happy\r\n",
      "concurrence of circumstances, there is, as I said, no immediate danger\r\n",
      "from that affection of the heart, which I believe to have been the\r\n",
      "cause of his late attack. On the other hand, it is possible that the\r\n",
      "disease may develop itself more rapidly: it is one of those cases in\r\n",
      "which death is sometimes sudden. Nothing should be neglected which\r\n",
      "might be affected by such an issue.”\r\n",

      "little more regret than usual that Rosamond, who was just come in and\r\n",
      "met her in walking-dress, was almost as expensively equipped. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode was a feminine smaller edition of her brother, and had none\r\n",
      "of her husband’s low-toned pallor. She had a good honest glance and\r\n",
      "used no circumlocution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are alone, I see, my dear,” she said, as they entered the\r\n",
      "drawing-room together, looking round gravely. Rosamond felt sure that\r\n",
      "her aunt had something particular to say, and they sat down near each\r\n",
      "other. Nevertheless, the quilling inside Rosamond’s bonnet was so\r\n",
      "charming that it was impossible not to desire the same kind of thing\r\n",
      "for Kate, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s eyes, which were rather fine, rolled\r\n",
      "round that ample quilled circuit, while she spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have just heard something about you that has surprised me very much,\r\n",
      "Rosamond.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I can hardly believe it—that you should be engaged without my knowing\r\n",

      "finally rested on Rosamond’s, who blushed deeply, and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not engaged, aunt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How is it that every one says so, then—that it is the town’s talk?”\r\n",

      "doing so. Mr. Ned Plymdale is a nice young man—some might think\r\n",
      "good-looking; and an only son; and a large business of that kind is\r\n",
      "better than a profession. Not that marrying is everything. I would have\r\n",
      "you seek first the kingdom of God. But a girl should keep her heart\r\n",
      "within her own power.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should never give it to Mr. Ned Plymdale, if it were. I have already\r\n",
      "refused him. If I loved, I should love at once and without change,”\r\n",
      "said Rosamond, with a great sense of being a romantic heroine, and\r\n",
      "playing the part prettily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I see how it is, my dear,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in a melancholy voice,\r\n",
      "rising to go. “You have allowed your affections to be engaged without\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed, aunt,” said Rosamond, with emphasis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you are quite confident that Mr. Lydgate has a serious attachment\r\n",
      "to you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s cheeks by this time were persistently burning, and she felt\r\n",
      "much mortification. She chose to be silent, and her aunt went away all\r\n",
      "the more convinced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent was disposed to do what\r\n",
      "his wife bade him, and she now, without telling her reasons, desired\r\n",
      "him on the next opportunity to find out in conversation with Mr.\r\n",
      "Lydgate whether he had any intention of marrying soon. The result was a\r\n",
      "decided negative. Mr. Bulstrode, on being cross-questioned, showed that\r\n",
      "Lydgate had spoken as no man would who had any attachment that could\r\n",
      "issue in matrimony. Mrs. Bulstrode now felt that she had a serious duty\r\n",
      "before her, and she soon managed to arrange a _tête-à-tête_ with\r\n",
      "Lydgate, in which she passed from inquiries about Fred Vincy’s health,\r\n",
      "and expressions of her sincere anxiety for her brother’s large family,\r\n",
      "to general remarks on the dangers which lay before young people with\r\n",
      "regard to their settlement in life. Young men were often wild and\r\n",
      "disappointing, making little return for the money spent on them, and a\r\n",
      "girl was exposed to many circumstances which might interfere with her\r\n",
      "prospects.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Especially when she has great attractions, and her parents see much\r\n",
      "company,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “Gentlemen pay her attention, and\r\n",
      "engross her all to themselves, for the mere pleasure of the moment, and\r\n",
      "that drives off others. I think it is a heavy responsibility, Mr.\r\n",
      "Lydgate, to interfere with the prospects of any girl.” Here Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode fixed her eyes on him, with an unmistakable purpose of\r\n",
      "warning, if not of rebuke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Clearly,” said Lydgate, looking at her—perhaps even staring a little\r\n",
      "in return. “On the other hand, a man must be a great coxcomb to go\r\n",
      "about with a notion that he must not pay attention to a young lady lest\r\n",
      "she should fall in love with him, or lest others should think she\r\n",
      "must.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Mr. Lydgate, you know well what your advantages are. You know that\r\n",
      "our young men here cannot cope with you. Where you frequent a house it\r\n",
      "may militate very much against a girl’s making a desirable settlement\r\n",
      "in life, and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate was less flattered by his advantage over the Middlemarch\r\n",
      "Orlandos than he was annoyed by the perception of Mrs. Bulstrode’s\r\n",
      "meaning. She felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was\r\n",
      "necessary to do, and that in using the superior word “militate” she had\r\n",
      "thrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still\r\n",
      "evident enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate was fuming a little, pushed his hair back with one hand, felt\r\n",
      "curiously in his waistcoat-pocket with the other, and then stooped to\r\n",
      "beckon the tiny black spaniel, which had the insight to decline his\r\n",
      "hollow caresses. It would not have been decent to go away, because he\r\n",
      "had been dining with other guests, and had just taken tea. But Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, having no doubt that she had been understood, turned the\r\n",
      "conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Solomon’s Proverbs, I think, have omitted to say, that as the sore\r\n",
      "palate findeth grit, so an uneasy consciousness heareth innuendoes. The\r\n",
      "next day Mr. Farebrother, parting from Lydgate in the street, supposed\r\n",
      "that they should meet at Vincy’s in the evening. Lydgate answered\r\n",
      "curtly, no—he had work to do—he must give up going out in the evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! you are going to get lashed to the mast, eh, and are stopping\r\n",
      "your ears?” said the Vicar. “Well, if you don’t mean to be won by the\r\n",
      "sirens, you are right to take precautions in time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few days before, Lydgate would have taken no notice of these words as\r\n",
      "anything more than the Vicar’s usual way of putting things. They seemed\r\n",
      "now to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that he had\r\n",
      "been making a fool of himself and behaving so as to be misunderstood:\r\n",
      "not, he believed, by Rosamond herself; she, he felt sure, took\r\n",
      "everything as lightly as he intended it. She had an exquisite tact and\r\n",
      "insight in relation to all points of manners; but the people she lived\r\n",
      "among were blunderers and busybodies. However, the mistake should go no\r\n",
      "farther. He resolved—and kept his resolution—that he would not go to\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy’s except on business.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond became very unhappy. The uneasiness first stirred by her\r\n",
      "aunt’s questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that she had\r\n",
      "not seen Lydgate, it grew into terror at the blank that might possibly\r\n",
      "come—into foreboding of that ready, fatal sponge which so cheaply wipes\r\n",
      "out the hopes of mortals. The world would have a new dreariness for\r\n",
      "her, as a wilderness that a magician’s spells had turned for a little\r\n",
      "while into a garden. She felt that she was beginning to know the pang\r\n",
      "of disappointed love, and that no other man could be the occasion of\r\n",
      "such delightful aerial building as she had been enjoying for the last\r\n",
      "six months. Poor Rosamond lost her appetite and felt as forlorn as\r\n",
      "Ariadne—as a charming stage Ariadne left behind with all her boxes full\r\n",
      "of costumes and no hope of a coach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike\r\n",
      "called love, and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an\r\n",
      "apology for everything (in literature and the drama). Happily Rosamond\r\n",
      "did not think of committing any desperate act: she plaited her fair\r\n",
      "hair as beautifully as usual, and kept herself proudly calm. Her most\r\n",
      "cheerful supposition was that her aunt Bulstrode had interfered in some\r\n",
      "way to hinder Lydgate’s visits: everything was better than a\r\n",
      "spontaneous indifference in him. Any one who imagines ten days too\r\n",
      "short a time—not for falling into leanness, lightness, or other\r\n",
      "measurable effects of passion, but—for the whole spiritual circuit of\r\n",
      "alarmed conjecture and disappointment, is ignorant of what can go on in\r\n",
      "the elegant leisure of a young lady’s mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the eleventh day, however, Lydgate when leaving Stone Court was\r\n",
      "requested by Mrs. Vincy to let her husband know that there was a marked\r\n",
      "change in Mr. Featherstone’s health, and that she wished him to come to\r\n",
      "Stone Court on that day. Now Lydgate might have called at the\r\n",
      "warehouse, or might have written a message on a leaf of his pocket-book\r\n",
      "and left it at the door. Yet these simple devices apparently did not\r\n",
      "occur to him, from which we may conclude that he had no strong\r\n",
      "objection to calling at the house at an hour when Mr. Vincy was not at\r\n",
      "home, and leaving the message with Miss Vincy. A man may, from various\r\n",
      "motives, decline to give his company, but perhaps not even a sage would\r\n",
      "be gratified that nobody missed him. It would be a graceful, easy way\r\n",
      "of piecing on the new habits to the old, to have a few playful words\r\n",
      "with Rosamond about his resistance to dissipation, and his firm resolve\r\n",
      "to take long fasts even from sweet sounds. It must be confessed, also,\r\n",
      "that momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs\r\n",
      "into the more substantial web of his thoughts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Vincy was alone, and blushed so deeply when Lydgate came in that\r\n",
      "he felt a corresponding embarrassment, and instead of any playfulness,\r\n",
      "he began at once to speak of his reason for calling, and to beg her,\r\n",
      "almost formally, to deliver the message to her father. Rosamond, who at\r\n",
      "the first moment felt as if her happiness were returning, was keenly\r\n",
      "hurt by Lydgate’s manner; her blush had departed, and she assented\r\n",
      "coldly, without adding an unnecessary word, some trivial chain-work\r\n",
      "which she had in her hands enabling her to avoid looking at Lydgate\r\n",
      "higher than his chin. In all failures, the beginning is certainly the\r\n",
      "half of the whole. After sitting two long moments while he moved his\r\n",
      "whip and could say nothing, Lydgate rose to go, and Rosamond, made\r\n",
      "nervous by her struggle between mortification and the wish not to\r\n",
      "betray it, dropped her chain as if startled, and rose too,\r\n",
      "mechanically. Lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain.\r\n",
      "When he rose he was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair\r\n",
      "long neck which he had been used to see turning about under the most\r\n",
      "perfect management of self-contented grace. But as he raised his eyes\r\n",
      "now he saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him quite newly,\r\n",
      "and made him look at Rosamond with a questioning flash. At this moment\r\n",
      "she was as natural as she had ever been when she was five years old:\r\n",
      "she felt that her tears had risen, and it was no use to try to do\r\n",
      "anything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let\r\n",
      "them fall over her cheeks, even as they would.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather-touch: it\r\n",
      "shook flirtation into love. Remember that the ambitious man who was\r\n",
      "looking at those Forget-me-nots under the water was very warm-hearted\r\n",
      "and rash. He did not know where the chain went; an idea had thrilled\r\n",
      "through the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in\r\n",
      "raising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed\r\n",
      "sepulchre, but under the lightest, easily pierced mould. His words were\r\n",
      "quite abrupt and awkward; but the tone made them sound like an ardent,\r\n",
      "appealing avowal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is the matter? you are distressed. Tell me, pray.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond had never been spoken to in such tones before. I am not sure\r\n",
      "that she knew what the words were: but she looked at Lydgate and the\r\n",
      "tears fell over her cheeks. There could have been no more complete\r\n",
      "answer than that silence, and Lydgate, forgetting everything else,\r\n",
      "completely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief\r\n",
      "that this sweet young creature depended on him for her joy, actually\r\n",
      "put his arms round her, folding her gently and protectingly—he was used\r\n",
      "to being gentle with the weak and suffering—and kissed each of the two\r\n",
      "large tears. This was a strange way of arriving at an understanding,\r\n",
      "but it was a short way. Rosamond was not angry, but she moved backward\r\n",
      "a little in timid happiness, and Lydgate could now sit near her and\r\n",
      "speak less incompletely. Rosamond had to make her little confession,\r\n",
      "and he poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive\r\n",
      "lavishment. In half an hour he left the house an engaged man, whose\r\n",
      "soul was not his own, but the woman’s to whom he had bound himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He came again in the evening to speak with Mr. Vincy, who, just\r\n",
      "returned from Stone Court, was feeling sure that it would not be long\r\n",
      "before he heard of Mr. Featherstone’s demise. The felicitous word\r\n",
      "“demise,” which had seasonably occurred to him, had raised his spirits\r\n",
      "even above their usual evening pitch. The right word is always a power,\r\n",
      "and communicates its definiteness to our action. Considered as a\r\n",
      "demise, old Featherstone’s death assumed a merely legal aspect, so that\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy could tap his snuff-box over it and be jovial, without even\r\n",
      "an intermittent affectation of solemnity; and Mr. Vincy hated both\r\n",
      "solemnity and affectation. Who was ever awe struck about a testator, or\r\n",
      "sang a hymn on the title to real property? Mr. Vincy was inclined to\r\n",
      "take a jovial view of all things that evening: he even observed to\r\n",
      "Lydgate that Fred had got the family constitution after all, and would\r\n",
      "soon be as fine a fellow as ever again; and when his approbation of\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s engagement was asked for, he gave it with astonishing\r\n",
      "facility, passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of\r\n",
      "matrimony for young men and maidens, and apparently deducing from the\r\n",

      "the poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since Peter had done\r\n",
      "nothing for them in his life, he would remember them at the last. Jonah\r\n",
      "argued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills, while Martha\r\n",
      "said that nobody need be surprised if he left the best part of his\r\n",
      "money to those who least expected it. Also it was not to be thought but\r\n",

      "there was a family interest to be attended to, and thought of Stone\r\n",
      "Court as a place which it would be nothing but right for them to visit.\r\n",
      "Sister Martha, otherwise Mrs. Cranch, living with some wheeziness in\r\n",

      "brotherly opinion. Seated in a famous arm-chair and in his best suit,\r\n",

      "among the Featherstones, and joked with the maid-servants when they\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "the Chalky Flats to represent his mother and watch his uncle Jonah,\r\n",
      "also felt it his duty to stay and to sit chiefly in the kitchen to give\r\n",
      "his uncle company. Young Cranch was not exactly the balancing point\r\n",
      "between the wit and the idiot,—verging slightly towards the latter\r\n",
      "type, and squinting so as to leave everything in doubt about his\r\n",

      "her with his cold detective eyes, young Cranch turning his head in the\r\n",
      "same direction seemed to insist on it that she should remark how he was\r\n",
      "squinting, as if he did it with design, like the gypsies when Borrow\r\n",
      "read the New Testament to them. This was rather too much for poor Mary;\r\n",
      "sometimes it made her bilious, sometimes it upset her gravity. One day\r\n",
      "that she had an opportunity she could not resist describing the kitchen\r\n",
      "scene to Fred, who would not be hindered from immediately going to see\r\n",
      "it, affecting simply to pass through. But no sooner did he face the\r\n",
      "four eyes than he had to rush through the nearest door which happened\r\n",
      "to lead to the dairy, and there under the high roof and among the pans\r\n",
      "he gave way to laughter which made a hollow resonance perfectly audible\r\n",
      "in the kitchen. He fled by another doorway, but Mr. Jonah, who had not\r\n",
      "before seen Fred’s white complexion, long legs, and pinched delicacy of\r\n",
      "face, prepared many sarcasms in which these points of appearance were\r\n",
      "wittily combined with the lowest moral attributes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, Tom, _you_ don’t wear such gentlemanly trousers—you haven’t got\r\n",
      "half such fine long legs,” said Jonah to his nephew, winking at the\r\n",
      "same time, to imply that there was something more in these statements\r\n",
      "than their undeniableness. Tom looked at his legs, but left it\r\n",
      "uncertain whether he preferred his moral advantages to a more vicious\r\n",
      "length of limb and reprehensible gentility of trouser.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs of eyes\r\n",
      "on the watch, and own relatives eager to be “sitters-up.” Many came,\r\n",
      "lunched, and departed, but Brother Solomon and the lady who had been\r\n",
      "Jane Featherstone for twenty-five years before she was Mrs. Waule found\r\n",
      "it good to be there every day for hours, without other calculable\r\n",
      "occupation than that of observing the cunning Mary Garth (who was so\r\n",
      "deep that she could be found out in nothing) and giving occasional dry\r\n",
      "wrinkly indications of crying—as if capable of torrents in a wetter\r\n",
      "season—at the thought that they were not allowed to go into Mr.\r\n",
      "Featherstone’s room. For the old man’s dislike of his own family seemed\r\n",
      "to get stronger as he got less able to amuse himself by saying biting\r\n",
      "things to them. Too languid to sting, he had the more venom refluent in\r\n",
      "his blood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not fully believing the message sent through Mary Garth, they had\r\n",
      "presented themselves together within the door of the bedroom, both in\r\n",
      "black—Mrs. Waule having a white handkerchief partially unfolded in her\r\n",
      "hand—and both with faces in a sort of half-mourning purple; while Mrs.\r\n",
      "Vincy with her pink cheeks and pink ribbons flying was actually\r\n",
      "administering a cordial to their own brother, and the\r\n",
      "light-complexioned Fred, his short hair curling as might be expected in\r\n",
      "a gambler’s, was lolling at his ease in a large chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Old Featherstone no sooner caught sight of these funereal figures\r\n",
      "appearing in spite of his orders than rage came to strengthen him more\r\n",
      "successfully than the cordial. He was propped up on a bed-rest, and\r\n",
      "always had his gold-headed stick lying by him. He seized it now and\r\n",
      "swept it backwards and forwards in as large an area as he could,\r\n",
      "apparently to ban these ugly spectres, crying in a hoarse sort of\r\n",
      "screech—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Back, back, Mrs. Waule! Back, Solomon!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Brother. Peter,” Mrs. Waule began—but Solomon put his hand before\r\n",
      "her repressingly. He was a large-cheeked man, nearly seventy, with\r\n",
      "small furtive eyes, and was not only of much blander temper but thought\r\n",
      "himself much deeper than his brother Peter; indeed not likely to be\r\n",
      "deceived in any of his fellow-men, inasmuch as they could not well be\r\n",
      "more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being. Even the\r\n",
      "invisible powers, he thought, were likely to be soothed by a bland\r\n",
      "parenthesis here and there—coming from a man of property, who might\r\n",
      "have been as impious as others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Brother Peter,” he said, in a wheedling yet gravely official tone,\r\n",
      "“It’s nothing but right I should speak to you about the Three Crofts\r\n",
      "and the Manganese. The Almighty knows what I’ve got on my mind—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then he knows more than I want to know,” said Peter, laying down his\r\n",
      "stick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too, for he\r\n",
      "reversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in case of\r\n",
      "closer fighting, and looked hard at Solomon’s bald head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s things you might repent of, Brother, for want of speaking to\r\n",
      "me,” said Solomon, not advancing, however. “I could sit up with you\r\n",
      "to-night, and Jane with me, willingly, and you might take your own time\r\n",
      "to speak, or let me speak.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I shall take my own time—you needn’t offer me yours,” said Peter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you can’t take your own time to die in, Brother,” began Mrs.\r\n",
      "Waule, with her usual woolly tone. “And when you lie speechless you may\r\n",
      "be tired of having strangers about you, and you may think of me and my\r\n",
      "children”—but here her voice broke under the touching thought which she\r\n",
      "was attributing to her speechless brother; the mention of ourselves\r\n",
      "being naturally affecting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I shan’t,” said old Featherstone, contradictiously. “I shan’t\r\n",
      "think of any of you. I’ve made my will, I tell you, I’ve made my will.”\r\n",
      "Here he turned his head towards Mrs. Vincy, and swallowed some more of\r\n",
      "his cordial.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to\r\n",
      "others,” said Mrs. Waule, turning her narrow eyes in the same\r\n",
      "direction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, sister,” said Solomon, with ironical softness, “you and me are not\r\n",
      "fine, and handsome, and clever enough: we must be humble and let smart\r\n",
      "people push themselves before us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred’s spirit could not bear this: rising and looking at Mr.\r\n",
      "Featherstone, he said, “Shall my mother and I leave the room, sir, that\r\n",
      "you may be alone with your friends?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sit down, I tell you,” said old Featherstone, snappishly. “Stop where\r\n",
      "you are. Good-by, Solomon,” he added, trying to wield his stick again,\r\n",
      "but failing now that he had reversed the handle. “Good-by, Mrs. Waule.\r\n",
      "Don’t you come again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall be down-stairs, Brother, whether or no,” said Solomon. “I\r\n",
      "shall do my duty, and it remains to be seen what the Almighty will\r\n",
      "allow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, in property going out of families,” said Mrs. Waule, in\r\n",
      "continuation,—“and where there’s steady young men to carry on. But I\r\n",
      "pity them who are not such, and I pity their mothers. Good-by, Brother\r\n",
      "Peter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Remember, I’m the eldest after you, Brother, and prospered from the\r\n",
      "first, just as you did, and have got land already by the name of\r\n",
      "Featherstone,” said Solomon, relying much on that reflection, as one\r\n",
      "which might be suggested in the watches of the night. “But I bid you\r\n",
      "good-by for the present.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their exit was hastened by their seeing old Mr. Featherstone pull his\r\n",
      "wig on each side and shut his eyes with his mouth-widening grimace, as\r\n",
      "if he were determined to be deaf and blind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "None the less they came to Stone Court daily and sat below at the post\r\n",
      "of duty, sometimes carrying on a slow dialogue in an undertone in which\r\n",
      "the observation and response were so far apart, that any one hearing\r\n",
      "them might have imagined himself listening to speaking automata, in\r\n",
      "some doubt whether the ingenious mechanism would really work, or wind\r\n",
      "itself up for a long time in order to stick and be silent. Solomon and\r\n",
      "Jane would have been sorry to be quick: what that led to might be seen\r\n",
      "on the other side of the wall in the person of Brother Jonah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But their watch in the wainscoted parlor was sometimes varied by the\r\n",
      "presence of other guests from far or near. Now that Peter Featherstone\r\n",
      "was up-stairs, his property could be discussed with all that local\r\n",
      "enlightenment to be found on the spot: some rural and Middlemarch\r\n",
      "neighbors expressed much agreement with the family and sympathy with\r\n",
      "their interest against the Vincys, and feminine visitors were even\r\n",
      "moved to tears, in conversation with Mrs. Waule, when they recalled the\r\n",
      "fact that they themselves had been disappointed in times past by\r\n",
      "codicils and marriages for spite on the part of ungrateful elderly\r\n",
      "gentlemen, who, it might have been supposed, had been spared for\r\n",
      "something better. Such conversation paused suddenly, like an organ when\r\n",
      "the bellows are let drop, if Mary Garth came into the room; and all\r\n",
      "eyes were turned on her as a possible legatee, or one who might get\r\n",
      "access to iron chests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the younger men who were relatives or connections of the family,\r\n",
      "were disposed to admire her in this problematic light, as a girl who\r\n",
      "showed much conduct, and who among all the chances that were flying\r\n",
      "might turn out to be at least a moderate prize. Hence she had her share\r\n",
      "of compliments and polite attentions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Especially from Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, a distinguished bachelor and\r\n",
      "auctioneer of those parts, much concerned in the sale of land and\r\n",
      "cattle: a public character, indeed, whose name was seen on widely\r\n",
      "distributed placards, and who might reasonably be sorry for those who\r\n",
      "did not know of him. He was second cousin to Peter Featherstone, and\r\n",
      "had been treated by him with more amenity than any other relative,\r\n",
      "being useful in matters of business; and in that programme of his\r\n",
      "funeral which the old man had himself dictated, he had been named as a\r\n",
      "Bearer. There was no odious cupidity in Mr. Borthrop Trumbull—nothing\r\n",
      "more than a sincere sense of his own merit, which, he was aware, in\r\n",
      "case of rivalry might tell against competitors; so that if Peter\r\n",
      "Featherstone, who so far as he, Trumbull, was concerned, had behaved\r\n",
      "like as good a soul as ever breathed, should have done anything\r\n",
      "handsome by him, all he could say was, that he had never fished and\r\n",
      "fawned, but had advised him to the best of his experience, which now\r\n",
      "extended over twenty years from the time of his apprenticeship at\r\n",
      "fifteen, and was likely to yield a knowledge of no surreptitious kind.\r\n",
      "His admiration was far from being confined to himself, but was\r\n",
      "accustomed professionally as well as privately to delight in estimating\r\n",
      "things at a high rate. He was an amateur of superior phrases, and never\r\n",
      "used poor language without immediately correcting himself—which was\r\n",
      "fortunate, as he was rather loud, and given to predominate, standing or\r\n",
      "walking about frequently, pulling down his waistcoat with the air of a\r\n",
      "man who is very much of his own opinion, trimming himself rapidly with\r\n",
      "his fore-finger, and marking each new series in these movements by a\r\n",
      "busy play with his large seals. There was occasionally a little\r\n",
      "fierceness in his demeanor, but it was directed chiefly against false\r\n",
      "opinion, of which there is so much to correct in the world that a man\r\n",
      "of some reading and experience necessarily has his patience tried. He\r\n",
      "felt that the Featherstone family generally was of limited\r\n",
      "understanding, but being a man of the world and a public character,\r\n",
      "took everything as a matter of course, and even went to converse with\r\n",
      "Mr. Jonah and young Cranch in the kitchen, not doubting that he had\r\n",
      "impressed the latter greatly by his leading questions concerning the\r\n",
      "Chalky Flats. If anybody had observed that Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, being\r\n",
      "an auctioneer, was bound to know the nature of everything, he would\r\n",
      "have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came\r\n",
      "pretty near that. On the whole, in an auctioneering way, he was an\r\n",
      "honorable man, not ashamed of his business, and feeling that “the\r\n",
      "celebrated Peel, now Sir Robert,” if introduced to him, would not fail\r\n",
      "to recognize his importance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t mind if I have a slice of that ham, and a glass of that ale,\r\n",
      "Miss Garth, if you will allow me,” he said, coming into the parlor at\r\n",
      "half-past eleven, after having had the exceptional privilege of seeing\r\n",
      "old Featherstone, and standing with his back to the fire between Mrs.\r\n",
      "Waule and Solomon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s not necessary for you to go out;—let me ring the bell.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Mary, “I have an errand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Mr. Trumbull, you’re highly favored,” said Mrs. Waule.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! seeing the old man?” said the auctioneer, playing with his seals\r\n",
      "dispassionately. “Ah, you see he has relied on me considerably.” Here\r\n",
      "he pressed his lips together, and frowned meditatively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?” said Solomon,\r\n",
      "in a soft tone of humility, in which he had a sense of luxurious\r\n",
      "cunning, he being a rich man and not in need of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes, anybody may ask,” said Mr. Trumbull, with loud and\r\n",
      "good-humored though cutting sarcasm. “Anybody may interrogate. Any one\r\n",
      "may give their remarks an interrogative turn,” he continued, his\r\n",
      "sonorousness rising with his style. “This is constantly done by good\r\n",
      "speakers, even when they anticipate no answer. It is what we call a\r\n",
      "figure of speech—speech at a high figure, as one may say.” The eloquent\r\n",
      "auctioneer smiled at his own ingenuity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shouldn’t be sorry to hear he’d remembered you, Mr. Trumbull,” said\r\n",
      "Solomon. “I never was against the deserving. It’s the undeserving I’m\r\n",
      "against.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, there it is, you see, there it is,” said Mr. Trumbull,\r\n",
      "significantly. “It can’t be denied that undeserving people have been\r\n",
      "legatees, and even residuary legatees. It is so, with testamentary\r\n",
      "dispositions.” Again he pursed up his lips and frowned a little.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you mean to say for certain, Mr. Trumbull, that my brother has left\r\n",
      "his land away from our family?” said Mrs. Waule, on whom, as an\r\n",
      "unhopeful woman, those long words had a depressing effect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A man might as well turn his land into charity land at once as leave\r\n",
      "it to some people,” observed Solomon, his sister’s question having\r\n",
      "drawn no answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, Blue-Coat land?” said Mrs. Waule, again. “Oh, Mr. Trumbull, you\r\n",
      "never can mean to say that. It would be flying in the face of the\r\n",
      "Almighty that’s prospered him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While Mrs. Waule was speaking, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull walked away from\r\n",
      "the fireplace towards the window, patrolling with his fore-finger round\r\n",
      "the inside of his stock, then along his whiskers and the curves of his\r\n",
      "hair. He now walked to Miss Garth’s work-table, opened a book which lay\r\n",
      "there and read the title aloud with pompous emphasis as if he were\r\n",
      "offering it for sale:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“‘Anne of Geierstein’ (pronounced Jeersteen) or the ‘Maiden of the\r\n",
      "Mist, by the author of Waverley.’” Then turning the page, he began\r\n",
      "sonorously—“The course of four centuries has well-nigh elapsed since\r\n",
      "the series of events which are related in the following chapters took\r\n",
      "place on the Continent.” He pronounced the last truly admirable word\r\n",
      "with the accent on the last syllable, not as unaware of vulgar usage,\r\n",
      "but feeling that this novel delivery enhanced the sonorous beauty which\r\n",
      "his reading had given to the whole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now the servant came in with the tray, so that the moments for\r\n",
      "answering Mrs. Waule’s question had gone by safely, while she and\r\n",
      "Solomon, watching Mr. Trumbull’s movements, were thinking that high\r\n",
      "learning interfered sadly with serious affairs. Mr. Borthrop Trumbull\r\n",
      "really knew nothing about old Featherstone’s will; but he could hardly\r\n",
      "have been brought to declare any ignorance unless he had been arrested\r\n",
      "for misprision of treason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale,” he said,\r\n",
      "reassuringly. “As a man with public business, I take a snack when I\r\n",
      "can. I will back this ham,” he added, after swallowing some morsels\r\n",
      "with alarming haste, “against any ham in the three kingdoms. In my\r\n",
      "opinion it is better than the hams at Freshitt Hall—and I think I am a\r\n",
      "tolerable judge.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some don’t like so much sugar in their hams,” said Mrs. Waule. “But my\r\n",
      "poor brother would always have sugar.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If any person demands better, he is at liberty to do so; but, God\r\n",
      "bless me, what an aroma! I should be glad to buy in that quality, I\r\n",
      "know. There is some gratification to a gentleman”—here Mr. Trumbull’s\r\n",
      "voice conveyed an emotional remonstrance—“in having this kind of ham\r\n",
      "set on his table.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He pushed aside his plate, poured out his glass of ale and drew his\r\n",
      "chair a little forward, profiting by the occasion to look at the inner\r\n",
      "side of his legs, which he stroked approvingly—Mr. Trumbull having all\r\n",
      "those less frivolous airs and gestures which distinguish the\r\n",
      "predominant races of the north.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have an interesting work there, I see, Miss Garth,” he observed,\r\n",
      "when Mary re-entered. “It is by the author of ‘Waverley’: that is Sir\r\n",
      "Walter Scott. I have bought one of his works myself—a very nice thing,\r\n",
      "a very superior publication, entitled ‘Ivanhoe.’ You will not get any\r\n",
      "writer to beat him in a hurry, I think—he will not, in my opinion, be\r\n",
      "speedily surpassed. I have just been reading a portion at the\r\n",
      "commencement of ‘Anne of Jeersteen.’ It commences well.” (Things never\r\n",
      "began with Mr. Borthrop Trumbull: they always commenced, both in\r\n",
      "private life and on his handbills.) “You are a reader, I see. Do you\r\n",
      "subscribe to our Middlemarch library?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Mary. “Mr. Fred Vincy brought this book.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am a great bookman myself,” returned Mr. Trumbull. “I have no less\r\n",
      "than two hundred volumes in calf, and I flatter myself they are well\r\n",
      "selected. Also pictures by Murillo, Rubens, Teniers, Titian, Vandyck,\r\n",
      "and others. I shall be happy to lend you any work you like to mention,\r\n",
      "Miss Garth.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am much obliged,” said Mary, hastening away again, “but I have\r\n",
      "little time for reading.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should say my brother has done something for _her_ in his will,”\r\n",
      "said Mr. Solomon, in a very low undertone, when she had shut the door\r\n",
      "behind her, pointing with his head towards the absent Mary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“His first wife was a poor match for him, though,” said Mrs. Waule.\r\n",
      "“She brought him nothing: and this young woman is only her niece,—and\r\n",

      "independent of the petty passions, the imbecile desires, the straining\r\n",

      "reason to believe that things were not likely to be arranged for her\r\n",
      "peculiar satisfaction, she wasted no time in astonishment and annoyance\r\n",

      "comedy in which she had a proud, nay, a generous resolution not to act\r\n",
      "the mean or treacherous part. Mary might have become cynical if she had\r\n",
      "not had parents whom she honored, and a well of affectionate gratitude\r\n",
      "within her, which was all the fuller because she had learned to make no\r\n",

      "carrying their fool’s caps unawares, thinking their own lies opaque\r\n",
      "while everybody else’s were transparent, making themselves exceptions\r\n",
      "to everything, as if when all the world looked yellow under a lamp they\r\n",
      "alone were rosy. Yet there were some illusions under Mary’s eyes which\r\n",
      "were not quite comic to her. She was secretly convinced, though she had\r\n",
      "no other grounds than her close observation of old Featherstone’s\r\n",
      "nature, that in spite of his fondness for having the Vincys about him,\r\n",
      "they were as likely to be disappointed as any of the relations whom he\r\n",

      "aged creature whose life is not visibly anything but a remnant of\r\n",
      "vices. She had always seen the most disagreeable side of Mr.\r\n",

      "had selected the key. He now unlocked the box, and, drawing from it\r\n",
      "another key, looked straight at her with eyes that seemed to have\r\n",

      "wills, and I’m going to burn one. Now you do as I tell you. This is the\r\n",
      "key of my iron chest, in the closet there. You push well at the side of\r\n",
      "the brass plate at the top, till it goes like a bolt: then you can put\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The old man paused with a blank stare for a little while, holding the\r\n",

      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He made an effort to stretch out the key towards her as far as\r\n",
      "possible, and Mary again retreated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will not touch your key or your money, sir. Pray don’t ask me to do\r\n",

      "tone as she could command, “Pray put up your money, sir;” and then went\r\n",
      "away to her seat by the fire, hoping this would help to convince him\r\n",
      "that it was useless to say more. Presently he rallied and said eagerly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here, then. Call the young chap. Call Fred Vincy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary’s heart began to beat more quickly. Various ideas rushed through\r\n",

      "to make a difficult decision in a hurry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "flaring of nervous energy which enabled him to speak again and again\r\n",
      "without falling into his usual cough; yet she desired not to push\r\n",
      "unnecessarily the contradiction which agitated him. “Let me, pray, call\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You let me alone, I say. Look here, missy. Take the money. You’ll\r\n",
      "never have the chance again. It’s pretty nigh two hundred—there’s more\r\n",
      "in the box, and nobody knows how much there was. Take it and do as I\r\n",
      "tell you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary, standing by the fire, saw its red light falling on the old man,\r\n",
      "propped up on his pillows and bed-rest, with his bony hand holding out\r\n",
      "the key, and the money lying on the quilt before him. She never forgot\r\n",
      "that vision of a man wanting to do as he liked at the last. But the way\r\n",
      "in which he had put the offer of the money urged her to speak with\r\n",
      "harder resolution than ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is of no use, sir. I will not do it. Put up your money. I will not\r\n",

      "will not touch your keys or your money.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Anything else—anything else!” said old Featherstone, with hoarse rage,\r\n",
      "which, as if in a nightmare, tried to be loud, and yet was only just\r\n",
      "audible. “I want nothing else. You come here—you come here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary approached him cautiously, knowing him too well. She saw him\r\n",
      "dropping his keys and trying to grasp his stick, while he looked at her\r\n",
      "like an aged hyena, the muscles of his face getting distorted with the\r\n",
      "effort of his hand. She paused at a safe distance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me give you some cordial,” she said, quietly, “and try to compose\r\n",
      "yourself. You will perhaps go to sleep. And to-morrow by daylight you\r\n",
      "can do as you like.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He lifted the stick, in spite of her being beyond his reach, and threw\r\n",
      "it with a hard effort which was but impotence. It fell, slipping over\r\n",
      "the foot of the bed. Mary let it lie, and retreated to her chair by the\r\n",
      "fire. By-and-by she would go to him with the cordial. Fatigue would\r\n",
      "make him passive. It was getting towards the chillest moment of the\r\n",
      "morning, the fire had got low, and she could see through the chink\r\n",
      "between the moreen window-curtains the light whitened by the blind.\r\n",
      "Having put some wood on the fire and thrown a shawl over her, she sat\r\n",
      "down, hoping that Mr. Featherstone might now fall asleep. If she went\r\n",
      "near him the irritation might be kept up. He had said nothing after\r\n",
      "throwing the stick, but she had seen him taking his keys again and\r\n",
      "laying his right hand on the money. He did not put it up, however, and\r\n",
      "she thought that he was dropping off to sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mary herself began to be more agitated by the remembrance of what\r\n",
      "she had gone through, than she had been by the reality—questioning\r\n",
      "those acts of hers which had come imperatively and excluded all\r\n",
      "question in the critical moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently the dry wood sent out a flame which illuminated every\r\n",
      "crevice, and Mary saw that the old man was lying quietly with his head\r\n",
      "turned a little on one side. She went towards him with inaudible steps,\r\n",
      "and thought that his face looked strangely motionless; but the next\r\n",
      "moment the movement of the flame communicating itself to all objects\r\n",
      "made her uncertain. The violent beating of her heart rendered her\r\n",
      "perceptions so doubtful that even when she touched him and listened for\r\n",
      "his breathing, she could not trust her conclusions. She went to the\r\n",
      "window and gently propped aside the curtain and blind, so that the\r\n",
      "still light of the sky fell on the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next moment she ran to the bell and rang it energetically. In a\r\n",

      "devoured by the ever-lean and ever-hungry passion of saving, and who\r\n",

      "difficult journey for this purpose from the Chalky Flats. She and Jane\r\n",

      "illusion. In writing the programme for his burial he certainly did not\r\n",
      "make clear to himself that his pleasure in the little drama of which it\r\n",
      "formed a part was confined to anticipation. In chuckling over the\r\n",
      "vexations he could inflict by the rigid clutch of his dead hand, he\r\n",

      "understrappers, he was resolved to be buried by a beneficed clergyman.\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon was out of the question, not merely because he declined\r\n",
      "duty of this sort, but because Featherstone had an especial dislike to\r\n",
      "him as the rector of his own parish, who had a lien on the land in the\r\n",
      "shape of tithe, also as the deliverer of morning sermons, which the old\r\n",
      "man, being in his pew and not at all sleepy, had been obliged to sit\r\n",
      "through with an inward snarl. He had an objection to a parson stuck up\r\n",
      "above his head preaching to him. But his relations with Mr. Cadwallader\r\n",
      "had been of a different kind: the trout-stream which ran through Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s land took its course through Featherstone’s also, so that\r\n",
      "Mr. Cadwallader was a parson who had had to ask a favor instead of\r\n",
      "preaching. Moreover, he was one of the high gentry living four miles\r\n",
      "away from Lowick, and was thus exalted to an equal sky with the sheriff\r\n",
      "of the county and other dignities vaguely regarded as necessary to the\r\n",
      "system of things. There would be a satisfaction in being buried by Mr.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader, whose very name offered a fine opportunity for pronouncing\r\n",
      "wrongly if you liked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This distinction conferred on the Rector of Tipton and Freshitt was the\r\n",
      "reason why Mrs. Cadwallader made one of the group that watched old\r\n",
      "Featherstone’s funeral from an upper window of the manor. She was not\r\n",
      "fond of visiting that house, but she liked, as she said, to see\r\n",
      "collections of strange animals such as there would be at this funeral;\r\n",
      "and she had persuaded Sir James and the young Lady Chettam to drive the\r\n",
      "Rector and herself to Lowick in order that the visit might be\r\n",
      "altogether pleasant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will go anywhere with you, Mrs. Cadwallader,” Celia had said; “but I\r\n",
      "don’t like funerals.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, my dear, when you have a clergyman in your family you must\r\n",
      "accommodate your tastes: I did that very early. When I married Humphrey\r\n",
      "I made up my mind to like sermons, and I set out by liking the end very\r\n",
      "much. That soon spread to the middle and the beginning, because I\r\n",
      "couldn’t have the end without them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, to be sure not,” said the Dowager Lady Chettam, with stately\r\n",
      "emphasis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The upper window from which the funeral could be well seen was in the\r\n",
      "room occupied by Mr. Casaubon when he had been forbidden to work; but\r\n",
      "he had resumed nearly his habitual style of life now in spite of\r\n",
      "warnings and prescriptions, and after politely welcoming Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader had slipped again into the library to chew a cud of erudite\r\n",
      "mistake about Cush and Mizraim.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But for her visitors Dorothea too might have been shut up in the\r\n",
      "library, and would not have witnessed this scene of old Featherstone’s\r\n",
      "funeral, which, aloof as it seemed to be from the tenor of her life,\r\n",
      "always afterwards came back to her at the touch of certain sensitive\r\n",
      "points in memory, just as the vision of St. Peter’s at Rome was inwoven\r\n",
      "with moods of despondency. Scenes which make vital changes in our\r\n",
      "neighbors’ lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a\r\n",
      "particular aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for\r\n",
      "us with the epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity\r\n",
      "which lies in the selection of our keenest consciousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dream-like association of something alien and ill-understood with\r\n",
      "the deepest secrets of her experience seemed to mirror that sense of\r\n",
      "loneliness which was due to the very ardor of Dorothea’s nature. The\r\n",
      "country gentry of old time lived in a rarefied social air: dotted apart\r\n",
      "on their stations up the mountain they looked down with imperfect\r\n",
      "discrimination on the belts of thicker life below. And Dorothea was not\r\n",
      "at ease in the perspective and chilliness of that height.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall not look any more,” said Celia, after the train had entered\r\n",
      "the church, placing herself a little behind her husband’s elbow so that\r\n",
      "she could slyly touch his coat with her cheek. “I dare say Dodo likes\r\n",
      "it: she is fond of melancholy things and ugly people.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am fond of knowing something about the people I live among,” said\r\n",
      "Dorothea, who had been watching everything with the interest of a monk\r\n",
      "on his holiday tour. “It seems to me we know nothing of our neighbors,\r\n",
      "unless they are cottagers. One is constantly wondering what sort of\r\n",
      "lives other people lead, and how they take things. I am quite obliged\r\n",
      "to Mrs. Cadwallader for coming and calling me out of the library.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite right to feel obliged to me,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Your rich\r\n",
      "Lowick farmers are as curious as any buffaloes or bisons, and I dare\r\n",
      "say you don’t half see them at church. They are quite different from\r\n",
      "your uncle’s tenants or Sir James’s—monsters—farmers without\r\n",
      "landlords—one can’t tell how to class them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Most of these followers are not Lowick people,” said Sir James; “I\r\n",
      "suppose they are legatees from a distance, or from Middlemarch.\r\n",
      "Lovegood tells me the old fellow has left a good deal of money as well\r\n",
      "as land.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Think of that now! when so many younger sons can’t dine at their own\r\n",
      "expense,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Ah,” turning round at the sound of\r\n",
      "the opening door, “here is Mr. Brooke. I felt that we were incomplete\r\n",
      "before, and here is the explanation. You are come to see this odd\r\n",
      "funeral, of course?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I came to look after Casaubon—to see how he goes on, you know. And\r\n",
      "to bring a little news—a little news, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\n",
      "nodding at Dorothea as she came towards him. “I looked into the\r\n",
      "library, and I saw Casaubon over his books. I told him it wouldn’t do:\r\n",
      "I said, ‘This will never do, you know: think of your wife, Casaubon.’\r\n",
      "And he promised me to come up. I didn’t tell him my news: I said, he\r\n",
      "must come up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, now they are coming out of church,” Mrs. Cadwallader exclaimed.\r\n",
      "“Dear me, what a wonderfully mixed set! Mr. Lydgate as doctor, I\r\n",
      "suppose. But that is really a good looking woman, and the fair young\r\n",
      "man must be her son. Who are they, Sir James, do you know?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I see Vincy, the Mayor of Middlemarch; they are probably his wife and\r\n",
      "son,” said Sir James, looking interrogatively at Mr. Brooke, who nodded\r\n",
      "and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, a very decent family—a very good fellow is Vincy; a credit to the\r\n",
      "manufacturing interest. You have seen him at my house, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, yes: one of your secret committee,” said Mrs. Cadwallader,\r\n",
      "provokingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A coursing fellow, though,” said Sir James, with a fox-hunter’s\r\n",
      "disgust.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And one of those who suck the life out of the wretched handloom\r\n",
      "weavers in Tipton and Freshitt. That is how his family look so fair and\r\n",
      "sleek,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Those dark, purple-faced people are an\r\n",
      "excellent foil. Dear me, they are like a set of jugs! Do look at\r\n",
      "Humphrey: one might fancy him an ugly archangel towering above them in\r\n",
      "his white surplice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a solemn thing, though, a funeral,” said Mr. Brooke, “if you take\r\n",
      "it in that light, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I am not taking it in that light. I can’t wear my solemnity too\r\n",
      "often, else it will go to rags. It was time the old man died, and none\r\n",
      "of these people are sorry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How piteous!” said Dorothea. “This funeral seems to me the most dismal\r\n",
      "thing I ever saw. It is a blot on the morning. I cannot bear to think\r\n",
      "that any one should die and leave no love behind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was going to say more, but she saw her husband enter and seat\r\n",
      "himself a little in the background. The difference his presence made to\r\n",
      "her was not always a happy one: she felt that he often inwardly\r\n",
      "objected to her speech.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Positively,” exclaimed Mrs. Cadwallader, “there is a new face come out\r\n",
      "from behind that broad man queerer than any of them: a little round\r\n",
      "head with bulging eyes—a sort of frog-face—do look. He must be of\r\n",
      "another blood, I think.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me see!” said Celia, with awakened curiosity, standing behind Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader and leaning forward over her head. “Oh, what an odd face!”\r\n",
      "Then with a quick change to another sort of surprised expression, she\r\n",
      "added, “Why, Dodo, you never told me that Mr. Ladislaw was come again!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt a shock of alarm: every one noticed her sudden paleness\r\n",
      "as she looked up immediately at her uncle, while Mr. Casaubon looked at\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He came with me, you know; he is my guest—puts up with me at the\r\n",
      "Grange,” said Mr. Brooke, in his easiest tone, nodding at Dorothea, as\r\n",
      "if the announcement were just what she might have expected. “And we\r\n",
      "have brought the picture at the top of the carriage. I knew you would\r\n",
      "be pleased with the surprise, Casaubon. There you are to the very\r\n",
      "life—as Aquinas, you know. Quite the right sort of thing. And you will\r\n",
      "hear young Ladislaw talk about it. He talks uncommonly well—points out\r\n",
      "this, that, and the other—knows art and everything of that\r\n",
      "kind—companionable, you know—is up with you in any track—what I’ve been\r\n",
      "wanting a long while.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon bowed with cold politeness, mastering his irritation, but\r\n",
      "only so far as to be silent. He remembered Will’s letter quite as well\r\n",
      "as Dorothea did; he had noticed that it was not among the letters which\r\n",
      "had been reserved for him on his recovery, and secretly concluding that\r\n",
      "Dorothea had sent word to Will not to come to Lowick, he had shrunk\r\n",
      "with proud sensitiveness from ever recurring to the subject. He now\r\n",
      "inferred that she had asked her uncle to invite Will to the Grange; and\r\n",
      "she felt it impossible at that moment to enter into any explanation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Cadwallader’s eyes, diverted from the churchyard, saw a good deal\r\n",
      "of dumb show which was not so intelligible to her as she could have\r\n",
      "desired, and could not repress the question, “Who is Mr. Ladislaw?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A young relative of Mr. Casaubon’s,” said Sir James, promptly. His\r\n",
      "good-nature often made him quick and clear-seeing in personal matters,\r\n",
      "and he had divined from Dorothea’s glance at her husband that there was\r\n",
      "some alarm in her mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A very nice young fellow—Casaubon has done everything for him,”\r\n",
      "explained Mr. Brooke. “He repays your expense in him, Casaubon,” he\r\n",
      "went on, nodding encouragingly. “I hope he will stay with me a long\r\n",
      "while and we shall make something of my documents. I have plenty of\r\n",
      "ideas and facts, you know, and I can see he is just the man to put them\r\n",
      "into shape—remembers what the right quotations are, _omne tulit\r\n",
      "punctum_, and that sort of thing—gives subjects a kind of turn. I\r\n",
      "invited him some time ago when you were ill, Casaubon; Dorothea said\r\n",
      "you couldn’t have anybody in the house, you know, and she asked me to\r\n",
      "write.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Dorothea felt that every word of her uncle’s was about as pleasant\r\n",
      "as a grain of sand in the eye to Mr. Casaubon. It would be altogether\r\n",
      "unfitting now to explain that she had not wished her uncle to invite\r\n",
      "Will Ladislaw. She could not in the least make clear to herself the\r\n",
      "reasons for her husband’s dislike to his presence—a dislike painfully\r\n",
      "impressed on her by the scene in the library; but she felt the\r\n",
      "unbecomingness of saying anything that might convey a notion of it to\r\n",
      "others. Mr. Casaubon, indeed, had not thoroughly represented those\r\n",
      "mixed reasons to himself; irritated feeling with him, as with all of\r\n",
      "us, seeking rather for justification than for self-knowledge. But he\r\n",
      "wished to repress outward signs, and only Dorothea could discern the\r\n",
      "changes in her husband’s face before he observed with more of dignified\r\n",
      "bending and sing-song than usual—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are exceedingly hospitable, my dear sir; and I owe you\r\n",
      "acknowledgments for exercising your hospitality towards a relative of\r\n",
      "mine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The funeral was ended now, and the churchyard was being cleared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now you can see him, Mrs. Cadwallader,” said Celia. “He is just like a\r\n",
      "miniature of Mr. Casaubon’s aunt that hangs in Dorothea’s boudoir—quite\r\n",
      "nice-looking.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A very pretty sprig,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, dryly. “What is your\r\n",
      "nephew to be, Mr. Casaubon?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pardon me, he is not my nephew. He is my cousin.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you know,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “he is trying his wings. He is\r\n",
      "just the sort of young fellow to rise. I should be glad to give him an\r\n",
      "opportunity. He would make a good secretary, now, like Hobbes, Milton,\r\n",
      "Swift—that sort of man.”\r\n",

      "“I understand,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “One who can write speeches.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll fetch him in now, eh, Casaubon?” said Mr. Brooke. “He wouldn’t\r\n",
      "come in till I had announced him, you know. And we’ll go down and look\r\n",
      "at the picture. There you are to the life: a deep subtle sort of\r\n",
      "thinker with his fore-finger on the page, while Saint Bonaventure or\r\n",
      "somebody else, rather fat and florid, is looking up at the Trinity.\r\n",
      "Everything is symbolical, you know—the higher style of art: I like that\r\n",
      "up to a certain point, but not too far—it’s rather straining to keep up\r\n",
      "with, you know. But you are at home in that, Casaubon. And your\r\n",
      "painter’s flesh is good—solidity, transparency, everything of that\r\n",
      "sort. I went into that a great deal at one time. However, I’ll go and\r\n",

      "glances much as if he were valuing a tree, made a fine contrast with\r\n",
      "the alarm or scorn visible in other faces when the unknown mourner,\r\n",
      "whose name was understood to be Rigg, entered the wainscoted parlor and\r\n",
      "took his seat near the door to make part of the audience when the will\r\n",
      "should be read. Just then Mr. Solomon and Mr. Jonah were gone up-stairs\r\n",
      "with the lawyer to search for the will; and Mrs. Waule, seeing two\r\n",
      "vacant seats between herself and Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, had the spirit\r\n",
      "to move next to that great authority, who was handling his watch-seals\r\n",
      "and trimming his outlines with a determination not to show anything so\r\n",
      "compromising to a man of ability as wonder or surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose you know everything about what my poor brother’s done, Mr.\r\n",
      "Trumbull,” said Mrs. Waule, in the lowest of her woolly tones, while\r\n",
      "she turned her crape-shadowed bonnet towards Mr. Trumbull’s ear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My good lady, whatever was told me was told in confidence,” said the\r\n",
      "auctioneer, putting his hand up to screen that secret.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Them who’ve made sure of their good-luck may be disappointed yet,”\r\n",
      "Mrs. Waule continued, finding some relief in this communication.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hopes are often delusive,” said Mr. Trumbull, still in confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah!” said Mrs. Waule, looking across at the Vincys, and then moving\r\n",
      "back to the side of her sister Martha.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s wonderful how close poor Peter was,” she said, in the same\r\n",
      "undertones. “We none of us know what he might have had on his mind. I\r\n",
      "only hope and trust he wasn’t a worse liver than we think of, Martha.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Mrs. Cranch was bulky, and, breathing asthmatically, had the\r\n",
      "additional motive for making her remarks unexceptionable and giving\r\n",
      "them a general bearing, that even her whispers were loud and liable to\r\n",
      "sudden bursts like those of a deranged barrel-organ.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I never _was_ covetous, Jane,” she replied; “but I have six children\r\n",
      "and have buried three, and I didn’t marry into money. The eldest, that\r\n",
      "sits there, is but nineteen—so I leave you to guess. And stock always\r\n",
      "short, and land most awkward. But if ever I’ve begged and prayed; it’s\r\n",
      "been to God above; though where there’s one brother a bachelor and the\r\n",
      "other childless after twice marrying—anybody might think!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Vincy had glanced at the passive face of Mr. Rigg, and\r\n",
      "had taken out his snuff-box and tapped it, but had put it again\r\n",
      "unopened as an indulgence which, however clarifying to the judgment,\r\n",
      "was unsuited to the occasion. “I shouldn’t wonder if Featherstone had\r\n",
      "better feelings than any of us gave him credit for,” he observed, in\r\n",
      "the ear of his wife. “This funeral shows a thought about everybody: it\r\n",
      "looks well when a man wants to be followed by his friends, and if they\r\n",
      "are humble, not to be ashamed of them. I should be all the better\r\n",
      "pleased if he’d left lots of small legacies. They may be uncommonly\r\n",
      "useful to fellows in a small way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Everything is as handsome as could be, crape and silk and everything,”\r\n",
      "said Mrs. Vincy, contentedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I am sorry to say that Fred was under some difficulty in repressing\r\n",
      "a laugh, which would have been more unsuitable than his father’s\r\n",
      "snuff-box. Fred had overheard Mr. Jonah suggesting something about a\r\n",
      "“love-child,” and with this thought in his mind, the stranger’s face,\r\n",
      "which happened to be opposite him, affected him too ludicrously. Mary\r\n",
      "Garth, discerning his distress in the twitchings of his mouth, and his\r\n",
      "recourse to a cough, came cleverly to his rescue by asking him to\r\n",
      "change seats with her, so that he got into a shadowy corner. Fred was\r\n",
      "feeling as good-naturedly as possible towards everybody, including\r\n",
      "Rigg; and having some relenting towards all these people who were less\r\n",
      "lucky than he was aware of being himself, he would not for the world\r\n",
      "have behaved amiss; still, it was particularly easy to laugh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the entrance of the lawyer and the two brothers drew every one’s\r\n",
      "attention. The lawyer was Mr. Standish, and he had come to Stone Court\r\n",
      "this morning believing that he knew thoroughly well who would be\r\n",
      "pleased and who disappointed before the day was over. The will he\r\n",
      "expected to read was the last of three which he had drawn up for Mr.\r\n",
      "Featherstone. Mr. Standish was not a man who varied his manners: he\r\n",
      "behaved with the same deep-voiced, off-hand civility to everybody, as\r\n",
      "if he saw no difference in them, and talked chiefly of the hay-crop,\r\n",
      "which would be “very fine, by God!” of the last bulletins concerning\r\n",
      "the King, and of the Duke of Clarence, who was a sailor every inch of\r\n",
      "him, and just the man to rule over an island like Britain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Old Featherstone had often reflected as he sat looking at the fire that\r\n",
      "Standish would be surprised some day: it is true that if he had done as\r\n",
      "he liked at the last, and burnt the will drawn up by another lawyer, he\r\n",
      "would not have secured that minor end; still he had had his pleasure in\r\n",
      "ruminating on it. And certainly Mr. Standish was surprised, but not at\r\n",
      "all sorry; on the contrary, he rather enjoyed the zest of a little\r\n",
      "curiosity in his own mind, which the discovery of a second will added\r\n",
      "to the prospective amazement on the part of the Featherstone family.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah, they were held in utter\r\n",
      "suspense: it seemed to them that the old will would have a certain\r\n",
      "validity, and that there might be such an interlacement of poor Peter’s\r\n",
      "former and latter intentions as to create endless “lawing” before\r\n",
      "anybody came by their own—an inconvenience which would have at least\r\n",
      "the advantage of going all round. Hence the brothers showed a\r\n",
      "thoroughly neutral gravity as they re-entered with Mr. Standish; but\r\n",
      "Solomon took out his white handkerchief again with a sense that in any\r\n",
      "case there would be affecting passages, and crying at funerals, however\r\n",
      "dry, was customarily served up in lawn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps the person who felt the most throbbing excitement at this\r\n",
      "moment was Mary Garth, in the consciousness that it was she who had\r\n",
      "virtually determined the production of this second will, which might\r\n",
      "have momentous effects on the lot of some persons present. No soul\r\n",
      "except herself knew what had passed on that final night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The will I hold in my hand,” said Mr. Standish, who, seated at the\r\n",
      "table in the middle of the room, took his time about everything,\r\n",
      "including the coughs with which he showed a disposition to clear his\r\n",
      "voice, “was drawn up by myself and executed by our deceased friend on\r\n",
      "the 9th of August, 1825. But I find that there is a subsequent\r\n",
      "instrument hitherto unknown to me, bearing date the 20th of July, 1826,\r\n",
      "hardly a year later than the previous one. And there is farther, I\r\n",
      "see”—Mr. Standish was cautiously travelling over the document with his\r\n",
      "spectacles—“a codicil to this latter will, bearing date March 1, 1828.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear, dear!” said sister Martha, not meaning to be audible, but driven\r\n",
      "to some articulation under this pressure of dates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall begin by reading the earlier will,” continued Mr. Standish,\r\n",
      "“since such, as appears by his not having destroyed the document, was\r\n",
      "the intention of deceased.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The preamble was felt to be rather long, and several besides Solomon\r\n",
      "shook their heads pathetically, looking on the ground: all eyes avoided\r\n",
      "meeting other eyes, and were chiefly fixed either on the spots in the\r\n",
      "table-cloth or on Mr. Standish’s bald head; excepting Mary Garth’s.\r\n",
      "When all the rest were trying to look nowhere in particular, it was\r\n",
      "safe for her to look at them. And at the sound of the first “give and\r\n",
      "bequeath” she could see all complexions changing subtly, as if some\r\n",
      "faint vibration were passing through them, save that of Mr. Rigg. He\r\n",
      "sat in unaltered calm, and, in fact, the company, preoccupied with more\r\n",
      "important problems, and with the complication of listening to bequests\r\n",
      "which might or might not be revoked, had ceased to think of him. Fred\r\n",
      "blushed, and Mr. Vincy found it impossible to do without his snuff-box\r\n",
      "in his hand, though he kept it closed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The small bequests came first, and even the recollection that there was\r\n",
      "another will and that poor Peter might have thought better of it, could\r\n",
      "not quell the rising disgust and indignation. One likes to be done well\r\n",
      "by in every tense, past, present, and future. And here was Peter\r\n",
      "capable five years ago of leaving only two hundred apiece to his own\r\n",
      "brothers and sisters, and only a hundred apiece to his own nephews and\r\n",
      "nieces: the Garths were not mentioned, but Mrs. Vincy and Rosamond were\r\n",
      "each to have a hundred. Mr. Trumbull was to have the gold-headed cane\r\n",
      "and fifty pounds; the other second cousins and the cousins present were\r\n",
      "each to have the like handsome sum, which, as the saturnine cousin\r\n",
      "observed, was a sort of legacy that left a man nowhere; and there was\r\n",
      "much more of such offensive dribbling in favor of persons not\r\n",
      "present—problematical, and, it was to be feared, low connections.\r\n",
      "Altogether, reckoning hastily, here were about three thousand disposed\r\n",
      "of. Where then had Peter meant the rest of the money to go—and where\r\n",
      "the land? and what was revoked and what not revoked—and was the\r\n",
      "revocation for better or for worse? All emotion must be conditional,\r\n",
      "and might turn out to be the wrong thing. The men were strong enough to\r\n",
      "bear up and keep quiet under this confused suspense; some letting their\r\n",
      "lower lip fall, others pursing it up, according to the habit of their\r\n",
      "muscles. But Jane and Martha sank under the rush of questions, and\r\n",
      "began to cry; poor Mrs. Cranch being half moved with the consolation of\r\n",
      "getting any hundreds at all without working for them, and half aware\r\n",
      "that her share was scanty; whereas Mrs. Waule’s mind was entirely\r\n",
      "flooded with the sense of being an own sister and getting little, while\r\n",
      "somebody else was to have much. The general expectation now was that\r\n",
      "the “much” would fall to Fred Vincy, but the Vincys themselves were\r\n",
      "surprised when ten thousand pounds in specified investments were\r\n",
      "declared to be bequeathed to him:—was the land coming too? Fred bit his\r\n",
      "lips: it was difficult to help smiling, and Mrs. Vincy felt herself the\r\n",
      "happiest of women—possible revocation shrinking out of sight in this\r\n",
      "dazzling vision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was still a residue of personal property as well as the land, but\r\n",
      "the whole was left to one person, and that person was—O possibilities!\r\n",
      "O expectations founded on the favor of “close” old gentlemen! O endless\r\n",
      "vocatives that would still leave expression slipping helpless from the\r\n",
      "measurement of mortal folly!—that residuary legatee was Joshua Rigg,\r\n",
      "who was also sole executor, and who was to take thenceforth the name of\r\n",
      "Featherstone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a rustling which seemed like a shudder running round the\r\n",
      "room. Every one stared afresh at Mr. Rigg, who apparently experienced\r\n",
      "no surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A most singular testamentary disposition!” exclaimed Mr. Trumbull,\r\n",
      "preferring for once that he should be considered ignorant in the past.\r\n",
      "“But there is a second will—there is a further document. We have not\r\n",
      "yet heard the final wishes of the deceased.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary Garth was feeling that what they had yet to hear were not the\r\n",
      "final wishes. The second will revoked everything except the legacies to\r\n",
      "the low persons before mentioned (some alterations in these being the\r\n",
      "occasion of the codicil), and the bequest of all the land lying in\r\n",
      "Lowick parish with all the stock and household furniture, to Joshua\r\n",
      "Rigg. The residue of the property was to be devoted to the erection and\r\n",
      "endowment of almshouses for old men, to be called Featherstone’s\r\n",
      "Alms-Houses, and to be built on a piece of land near Middlemarch\r\n",
      "already bought for the purpose by the testator, he wishing—so the\r\n",
      "document declared—to please God Almighty. Nobody present had a\r\n",
      "farthing; but Mr. Trumbull had the gold-headed cane. It took some time\r\n",
      "for the company to recover the power of expression. Mary dared not look\r\n",
      "at Fred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy was the first to speak—after using his snuff-box\r\n",
      "energetically—and he spoke with loud indignation. “The most\r\n",
      "unaccountable will I ever heard! I should say he was not in his right\r\n",
      "mind when he made it. I should say this last will was void,” added Mr.\r\n",
      "Vincy, feeling that this expression put the thing in the true light.\r\n",
      "“Eh Standish?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Our deceased friend always knew what he was about, I think,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Standish. “Everything is quite regular. Here is a letter from Clemmens\r\n",
      "of Brassing tied with the will. He drew it up. A very respectable\r\n",
      "solicitor.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I never noticed any alienation of mind—any aberration of intellect in\r\n",
      "the late Mr. Featherstone,” said Borthrop Trumbull, “but I call this\r\n",
      "will eccentric. I was always willingly of service to the old soul; and\r\n",
      "he intimated pretty plainly a sense of obligation which would show\r\n",
      "itself in his will. The gold-headed cane is farcical considered as an\r\n",
      "acknowledgment to me; but happily I am above mercenary considerations.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s nothing very surprising in the matter that I can see,” said\r\n",
      "Caleb Garth. “Anybody might have had more reason for wondering if the\r\n",
      "will had been what you might expect from an open-minded straightforward\r\n",
      "man. For my part, I wish there was no such thing as a will.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s a strange sentiment to come from a Christian man, by God!” said\r\n",
      "the lawyer. “I should like to know how you will back that up, Garth!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh,” said Caleb, leaning forward, adjusting his finger-tips with\r\n",
      "nicety and looking meditatively on the ground. It always seemed to him\r\n",
      "that words were the hardest part of “business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But here Mr. Jonah Featherstone made himself heard. “Well, he always\r\n",
      "was a fine hypocrite, was my brother Peter. But this will cuts out\r\n",
      "everything. If I’d known, a wagon and six horses shouldn’t have drawn\r\n",
      "me from Brassing. I’ll put a white hat and drab coat on to-morrow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear, dear,” wept Mrs. Cranch, “and we’ve been at the expense of\r\n",
      "travelling, and that poor lad sitting idle here so long! It’s the first\r\n",
      "time I ever heard my brother Peter was so wishful to please God\r\n",

      "with a bitterness which was remarkably genuine, though his tone could\r\n",
      "not help being sly. “Peter was a bad liver, and almshouses won’t cover\r\n",
      "it, when he’s had the impudence to show it at the last.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "and nephews and nieces—and has sat in church with ’em whenever he\r\n",
      "thought well to come,” said Mrs. Waule. “And might have left his\r\n",
      "property so respectable, to them that’s never been used to extravagance\r\n",
      "or unsteadiness in no manner of way—and not so poor but what they could\r\n",
      "have saved every penny and made more of it. And me—the trouble I’ve\r\n",
      "been at, times and times, to come here and be sisterly—and him with\r\n",
      "things on his mind all the while that might make anybody’s flesh creep.\r\n",

      "“It’s a poor tale how luck goes in the world,” said Jonah. “It never\r\n",
      "answers to have a bit of spirit in you. You’d better be a dog in the\r\n",
      "manger. But those above ground might learn a lesson. One fool’s will is\r\n",
      "enough in a family.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s more ways than one of being a fool,” said Solomon. “I shan’t\r\n",
      "leave my money to be poured down the sink, and I shan’t leave it to\r\n",
      "foundlings from Africay. I like Featherstones that were brewed such,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Solomon addressed these remarks in a loud aside to Mrs. Waule as he\r\n",
      "rose to accompany her. Brother Jonah felt himself capable of much more\r\n",
      "stinging wit than this, but he reflected that there was no use in\r\n",
      "offending the new proprietor of Stone Court, until you were certain\r\n",
      "that he was quite without intentions of hospitality towards witty men\r\n",
      "whose name he was about to bear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Joshua Rigg, in fact, appeared to trouble himself little about any\r\n",
      "innuendoes, but showed a notable change of manner, walking coolly up to\r\n",
      "Mr. Standish and putting business questions with much coolness. He had\r\n",
      "a high chirping voice and a vile accent. Fred, whom he no longer moved\r\n",
      "to laughter, thought him the lowest monster he had ever seen. But Fred\r\n",
      "was feeling rather sick. The Middlemarch mercer waited for an\r\n",
      "opportunity of engaging Mr. Rigg in conversation: there was no knowing\r\n",
      "how many pairs of legs the new proprietor might require hose for, and\r\n",
      "profits were more to be relied on than legacies. Also, the mercer, as a\r\n",

      "Mr. Vincy, after his one outburst, had remained proudly silent, though\r\n",
      "too much preoccupied with unpleasant feelings to think of moving, till\r\n",
      "he observed that his wife had gone to Fred’s side and was crying\r\n",
      "silently while she held her darling’s hand. He rose immediately, and\r\n",
      "turning his back on the company while he said to her in an\r\n",
      "undertone,—“Don’t give way, Lucy; don’t make a fool of yourself, my\r\n",
      "dear, before these people,” he added in his usual loud voice—“Go and\r\n",

      "courage to look at him. He had that withered sort of paleness which\r\n",
      "will sometimes come on young faces, and his hand was very cold when she\r\n",
      "shook it. Mary too was agitated; she was conscious that fatally,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "I must go into the Church now.” (He knew that this would vex Mary: very\r\n",
      "well; then she must tell him what else he could do.) “And I thought I\r\n",
      "should be able to pay your father at once and make everything right.\r\n",

      "to employ others in making the offensive retractation. However, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Vincy, who never willingly opposed her husband, lost no time the next\r\n",

      "some muslin-work, listened in silence, and at the end gave a certain\r\n",

      "as he was, had as little of his own way as if he had been a prime\r\n",

      "is for most pleasure-loving florid men; and the circumstance called\r\n",
      "Rosamond was particularly forcible by means of that mild persistence\r\n",
      "which, as we know, enables a white soft living substance to make its\r\n",
      "way in spite of opposing rock. Papa was not a rock: he had no other\r\n",
      "fixity than that fixity of alternating impulses sometimes called habit,\r\n",
      "and this was altogether unfavorable to his taking the only decisive\r\n",
      "line of conduct in relation to his daughter’s engagement—namely, to\r\n",
      "inquire thoroughly into Lydgate’s circumstances, declare his own\r\n",
      "inability to furnish money, and forbid alike either a speedy marriage\r\n",
      "or an engagement which must be too lengthy. That seems very simple and\r\n",
      "easy in the statement; but a disagreeable resolve formed in the chill\r\n",
      "hours of the morning had as many conditions against it as the early\r\n",
      "frost, and rarely persisted under the warming influences of the day.\r\n",
      "The indirect though emphatic expression of opinion to which Mr. Vincy\r\n",
      "was prone suffered much restraint in this case: Lydgate was a proud man\r\n",
      "towards whom innuendoes were obviously unsafe, and throwing his hat on\r\n",
      "the floor was out of the question. Mr. Vincy was a little in awe of\r\n",
      "him, a little vain that he wanted to marry Rosamond, a little\r\n",
      "indisposed to raise a question of money in which his own position was\r\n",
      "not advantageous, a little afraid of being worsted in dialogue with a\r\n",
      "man better educated and more highly bred than himself, and a little\r\n",
      "afraid of doing what his daughter would not like. The part Mr. Vincy\r\n",
      "preferred playing was that of the generous host whom nobody criticises.\r\n",
      "In the earlier half of the day there was business to hinder any formal\r\n",
      "communication of an adverse resolve; in the later there was dinner,\r\n",
      "wine, whist, and general satisfaction. And in the mean while the hours\r\n",
      "were each leaving their little deposit and gradually forming the final\r\n",
      "reason for inaction, namely, that action was too late. The accepted\r\n",
      "lover spent most of his evenings in Lowick Gate, and a love-making not\r\n",
      "at all dependent on money-advances from fathers-in-law, or prospective\r\n",
      "income from a profession, went on flourishingly under Mr. Vincy’s own\r\n",
      "eyes. Young love-making—that gossamer web! Even the points it clings\r\n",
      "to—the things whence its subtle interlacings are swung—are scarcely\r\n",
      "perceptible: momentary touches of fingertips, meetings of rays from\r\n",
      "blue and dark orbs, unfinished phrases, lightest changes of cheek and\r\n",
      "lip, faintest tremors. The web itself is made of spontaneous beliefs\r\n",
      "and indefinable joys, yearnings of one life towards another, visions of\r\n",
      "completeness, indefinite trust. And Lydgate fell to spinning that web\r\n",
      "from his inward self with wonderful rapidity, in spite of experience\r\n",
      "supposed to be finished off with the drama of Laure—in spite too of\r\n",
      "medicine and biology; for the inspection of macerated muscle or of eyes\r\n",
      "presented in a dish (like Santa Lucia’s), and other incidents of\r\n",
      "scientific inquiry, are observed to be less incompatible with poetic\r\n",
      "love than a native dulness or a lively addiction to the lowest prose.\r\n",
      "As for Rosamond, she was in the water-lily’s expanding wonderment at\r\n",
      "its own fuller life, and she too was spinning industriously at the\r\n",
      "mutual web. All this went on in the corner of the drawing-room where\r\n",
      "the piano stood, and subtle as it was, the light made it a sort of\r\n",
      "rainbow visible to many observers besides Mr. Farebrother. The\r\n",
      "certainty that Miss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate were engaged became general\r\n",
      "in Middlemarch without the aid of formal announcement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aunt Bulstrode was again stirred to anxiety; but this time she\r\n",
      "addressed herself to her brother, going to the warehouse expressly to\r\n",
      "avoid Mrs. Vincy’s volatility. His replies were not satisfactory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Walter, you never mean to tell me that you have allowed all this to go\r\n",
      "on without inquiry into Mr. Lydgate’s prospects?” said Mrs. Bulstrode,\r\n",
      "opening her eyes with wider gravity at her brother, who was in his\r\n",
      "peevish warehouse humor. “Think of this girl brought up in luxury—in\r\n",
      "too worldly a way, I am sorry to say—what will she do on a small\r\n",
      "income?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, confound it, Harriet! What can I do when men come into the town\r\n",
      "without any asking of mine? Did you shut your house up against Lydgate?\r\n",
      "Bulstrode has pushed him forward more than anybody. I never made any\r\n",
      "fuss about the young fellow. You should go and talk to your husband\r\n",
      "about it, not me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, really, Walter, how can Mr. Bulstrode be to blame? I am sure he\r\n",
      "did not wish for the engagement.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, if Bulstrode had not taken him by the hand, I should never have\r\n",
      "invited him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you called him in to attend on Fred, and I am sure that was a\r\n",
      "mercy,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, losing her clew in the intricacies of the\r\n",
      "subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know about mercy,” said Mr. Vincy, testily. “I know I am\r\n",
      "worried more than I like with my family. I was a good brother to you,\r\n",
      "Harriet, before you married Bulstrode, and I must say he doesn’t always\r\n",
      "show that friendly spirit towards your family that might have been\r\n",
      "expected of him.” Mr. Vincy was very little like a Jesuit, but no\r\n",
      "accomplished Jesuit could have turned a question more adroitly. Harriet\r\n",
      "had to defend her husband instead of blaming her brother, and the\r\n",
      "conversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as some recent\r\n",
      "sparring between the brothers-in-law at a vestry meeting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bulstrode did not repeat her brother’s complaints to her husband,\r\n",
      "but in the evening she spoke to him of Lydgate and Rosamond. He did not\r\n",
      "share her warm interest, however; and only spoke with resignation of\r\n",
      "the risks attendant on the beginning of medical practice and the\r\n",
      "desirability of prudence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure we are bound to pray for that thoughtless girl—brought up as\r\n",
      "she has been,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, wishing to rouse her husband’s\r\n",
      "feelings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Truly, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, assentingly. “Those who are not\r\n",
      "of this world can do little else to arrest the errors of the\r\n",
      "obstinately worldly. That is what we must accustom ourselves to\r\n",
      "recognize with regard to your brother’s family. I could have wished\r\n",
      "that Mr. Lydgate had not entered into such a union; but my relations\r\n",
      "with him are limited to that use of his gifts for God’s purposes which\r\n",
      "is taught us by the divine government under each dispensation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bulstrode said no more, attributing some dissatisfaction which she\r\n",
      "felt to her own want of spirituality. She believed that her husband was\r\n",
      "one of those men whose memoirs should be written when they died.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to Lydgate himself, having been accepted, he was prepared to accept\r\n",
      "all the consequences which he believed himself to foresee with perfect\r\n",
      "clearness. Of course he must be married in a year—perhaps even in half\r\n",
      "a year. This was not what he had intended; but other schemes would not\r\n",
      "be hindered: they would simply adjust themselves anew. Marriage, of\r\n",
      "course, must be prepared for in the usual way. A house must be taken\r\n",
      "instead of the rooms he at present occupied; and Lydgate, having heard\r\n",
      "Rosamond speak with admiration of old Mrs. Bretton’s house (situated in\r\n",
      "Lowick Gate), took notice when it fell vacant after the old lady’s\r\n",
      "death, and immediately entered into treaty for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did this in an episodic way, very much as he gave orders to his\r\n",
      "tailor for every requisite of perfect dress, without any notion of\r\n",
      "being extravagant. On the contrary, he would have despised any\r\n",
      "ostentation of expense; his profession had familiarized him with all\r\n",
      "grades of poverty, and he cared much for those who suffered hardships.\r\n",
      "He would have behaved perfectly at a table where the sauce was served\r\n",
      "in a jug with the handle off, and he would have remembered nothing\r\n",
      "about a grand dinner except that a man was there who talked well. But\r\n",
      "it had never occurred to him that he should live in any other than what\r\n",
      "he would have called an ordinary way, with green glasses for hock, and\r\n",
      "excellent waiting at table. In warming himself at French social\r\n",
      "theories he had brought away no smell of scorching. We may handle even\r\n",
      "extreme opinions with impunity while our furniture, our dinner-giving,\r\n",
      "and preference for armorial bearings in our own case, link us\r\n",
      "indissolubly with the established order. And Lydgate’s tendency was not\r\n",
      "towards extreme opinions: he would have liked no barefooted doctrines,\r\n",
      "being particular about his boots: he was no radical in relation to\r\n",
      "anything but medical reform and the prosecution of discovery. In the\r\n",
      "rest of practical life he walked by hereditary habit; half from that\r\n",
      "personal pride and unreflecting egoism which I have already called\r\n",
      "commonness, and half from that naivete which belonged to preoccupation\r\n",
      "with favorite ideas.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Any inward debate Lydgate had as to the consequences of this engagement\r\n",
      "which had stolen upon him, turned on the paucity of time rather than of\r\n",
      "money. Certainly, being in love and being expected continually by some\r\n",
      "one who always turned out to be prettier than memory could represent\r\n",
      "her to be, did interfere with the diligent use of spare hours which\r\n",
      "might serve some “plodding fellow of a German” to make the great,\r\n",
      "imminent discovery. This was really an argument for not deferring the\r\n",
      "marriage too long, as he implied to Mr. Farebrother, one day that the\r\n",
      "Vicar came to his room with some pond-products which he wanted to\r\n",
      "examine under a better microscope than his own, and, finding Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "tableful of apparatus and specimens in confusion, said sarcastically—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Eros has degenerated; he began by introducing order and harmony, and\r\n",
      "now he brings back chaos.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, at some stages,” said Lydgate, lifting his brows and smiling,\r\n",
      "while he began to arrange his microscope. “But a better order will\r\n",
      "begin after.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Soon?” said the Vicar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope so, really. This unsettled state of affairs uses up the time,\r\n",
      "and when one has notions in science, every moment is an opportunity. I\r\n",
      "feel sure that marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to\r\n",
      "work steadily. He has everything at home then—no teasing with personal\r\n",
      "speculations—he can get calmness and freedom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are an enviable dog,” said the Vicar, “to have such a\r\n",
      "prospect—Rosamond, calmness and freedom, all to your share. Here am I\r\n",
      "with nothing but my pipe and pond-animalcules. Now, are you ready?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate did not mention to the Vicar another reason he had for wishing\r\n",
      "to shorten the period of courtship. It was rather irritating to him,\r\n",
      "even with the wine of love in his veins, to be obliged to mingle so\r\n",
      "often with the family party at the Vincys’, and to enter so much into\r\n",
      "Middlemarch gossip, protracted good cheer, whist-playing, and general\r\n",
      "futility. He had to be deferential when Mr. Vincy decided questions\r\n",
      "with trenchant ignorance, especially as to those liquors which were the\r\n",
      "best inward pickle, preserving you from the effects of bad air. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Vincy’s openness and simplicity were quite unstreaked with suspicion as\r\n",
      "to the subtle offence she might give to the taste of her intended\r\n",
      "son-in-law; and altogether Lydgate had to confess to himself that he\r\n",
      "was descending a little in relation to Rosamond’s family. But that\r\n",
      "exquisite creature herself suffered in the same sort of way:—it was at\r\n",
      "least one delightful thought that in marrying her, he could give her a\r\n",
      "much-needed transplantation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear!” he said to her one evening, in his gentlest tone, as he sat\r\n",
      "down by her and looked closely at her face—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I must first say that he had found her alone in the drawing-room,\r\n",
      "where the great old-fashioned window, almost as large as the side of\r\n",
      "the room, was opened to the summer scents of the garden at the back of\r\n",
      "the house. Her father and mother were gone to a party, and the rest\r\n",
      "were all out with the butterflies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear! your eyelids are red.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are they?” said Rosamond. “I wonder why.” It was not in her nature to\r\n",
      "pour forth wishes or grievances. They only came forth gracefully on\r\n",
      "solicitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As if you could hide it from me!” said Lydgate, laying his hand\r\n",
      "tenderly on both of hers. “Don’t I see a tiny drop on one of the\r\n",
      "lashes? Things trouble you, and you don’t tell me. That is unloving.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should I tell you what you cannot alter? They are every-day\r\n",
      "things:—perhaps they have been a little worse lately.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Family annoyances. Don’t fear speaking. I guess them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Papa has been more irritable lately. Fred makes him angry, and this\r\n",
      "morning there was a fresh quarrel because Fred threatens to throw his\r\n",
      "whole education away, and do something quite beneath him. And besides—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond hesitated, and her cheeks were gathering a slight flush.\r\n",
      "Lydgate had never seen her in trouble since the morning of their\r\n",
      "engagement, and he had never felt so passionately towards her as at\r\n",
      "this moment. He kissed the hesitating lips gently, as if to encourage\r\n",
      "them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I feel that papa is not quite pleased about our engagement,” Rosamond\r\n",
      "continued, almost in a whisper; “and he said last night that he should\r\n",
      "certainly speak to you and say it must be given up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you give it up?” said Lydgate, with quick energy—almost angrily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I never give up anything that I choose to do,” said Rosamond,\r\n",
      "recovering her calmness at the touching of this chord.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God bless you!” said Lydgate, kissing her again. This constancy of\r\n",
      "purpose in the right place was adorable. He went on:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is too late now for your father to say that our engagement must be\r\n",
      "given up. You are of age, and I claim you as mine. If anything is done\r\n",
      "to make you unhappy,—that is a reason for hastening our marriage.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An unmistakable delight shone forth from the blue eyes that met his,\r\n",
      "and the radiance seemed to light up all his future with mild sunshine.\r\n",
      "Ideal happiness (of the kind known in the Arabian Nights, in which you\r\n",
      "are invited to step from the labor and discord of the street into a\r\n",
      "paradise where everything is given to you and nothing claimed) seemed\r\n",
      "to be an affair of a few weeks’ waiting, more or less.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should we defer it?” he said, with ardent insistence. “I have\r\n",
      "taken the house now: everything else can soon be got ready—can it not?\r\n",
      "You will not mind about new clothes. Those can be bought afterwards.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What original notions you clever men have!” said Rosamond, dimpling\r\n",
      "with more thorough laughter than usual at this humorous incongruity.\r\n",
      "“This is the first time I ever heard of wedding-clothes being bought\r\n",
      "after marriage.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you don’t mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for\r\n",
      "the sake of clothes?” said Lydgate, half thinking that Rosamond was\r\n",
      "tormenting him prettily, and half fearing that she really shrank from\r\n",
      "speedy marriage. “Remember, we are looking forward to a better sort of\r\n",
      "happiness even than this—being continually together, independent of\r\n",
      "others, and ordering our lives as we will. Come, dear, tell me how soon\r\n",
      "you can be altogether mine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a serious pleading in Lydgate’s tone, as if he felt that she\r\n",
      "would be injuring him by any fantastic delays. Rosamond became serious\r\n",
      "too, and slightly meditative; in fact, she was going through many\r\n",
      "intricacies of lace-edging and hosiery and petticoat-tucking, in order\r\n",
      "to give an answer that would at least be approximative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Six weeks would be ample—say so, Rosamond,” insisted Lydgate,\r\n",
      "releasing her hands to put his arm gently round her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One little hand immediately went to pat her hair, while she gave her\r\n",
      "neck a meditative turn, and then said seriously—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There would be the house-linen and the furniture to be prepared.\r\n",
      "Still, mamma could see to those while we were away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, to be sure. We must be away a week or so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, more than that!” said Rosamond, earnestly. She was thinking of her\r\n",
      "evening dresses for the visit to Sir Godwin Lydgate’s, which she had\r\n",
      "long been secretly hoping for as a delightful employment of at least\r\n",
      "one quarter of the honeymoon, even if she deferred her introduction to\r\n",
      "the uncle who was a doctor of divinity (also a pleasing though sober\r\n",
      "kind of rank, when sustained by blood). She looked at her lover with\r\n",
      "some wondering remonstrance as she spoke, and he readily understood\r\n",
      "that she might wish to lengthen the sweet time of double solitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Whatever you wish, my darling, when the day is fixed. But let us take\r\n",
      "a decided course, and put an end to any discomfort you may be\r\n",
      "suffering. Six weeks!—I am sure they would be ample.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I could certainly hasten the work,” said Rosamond. “Will you, then,\r\n",
      "mention it to papa?—I think it would be better to write to him.” She\r\n",
      "blushed and looked at him as the garden flowers look at us when we walk\r\n",
      "forth happily among them in the transcendent evening light: is there\r\n",
      "not a soul beyond utterance, half nymph, half child, in those delicate\r\n",
      "petals which glow and breathe about the centres of deep color?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He touched her ear and a little bit of neck under it with his lips, and\r\n",
      "they sat quite still for many minutes which flowed by them like a small\r\n",
      "gurgling brook with the kisses of the sun upon it. Rosamond thought\r\n",
      "that no one could be more in love than she was; and Lydgate thought\r\n",
      "that after all his wild mistakes and absurd credulity, he had found\r\n",
      "perfect womanhood—felt as if already breathed upon by exquisite wedded\r\n",
      "affection such as would be bestowed by an accomplished creature who\r\n",
      "venerated his high musings and momentous labors and would never\r\n",
      "interfere with them; who would create order in the home and accounts\r\n",
      "with still magic, yet keep her fingers ready to touch the lute and\r\n",
      "transform life into romance at any moment; who was instructed to the\r\n",
      "true womanly limit and not a hair’s-breadth beyond—docile, therefore,\r\n",
      "and ready to carry out behests which came from that limit. It was\r\n",
      "plainer now than ever that his notion of remaining much longer a\r\n",
      "bachelor had been a mistake: marriage would not be an obstruction but a\r\n",
      "furtherance. And happening the next day to accompany a patient to\r\n",
      "Brassing, he saw a dinner-service there which struck him as so exactly\r\n",
      "the right thing that he bought it at once. It saved time to do these\r\n",
      "things just when you thought of them, and Lydgate hated ugly crockery.\r\n",
      "The dinner-service in question was expensive, but that might be in the\r\n",
      "nature of dinner-services. Furnishing was necessarily expensive; but\r\n",
      "then it had to be done only once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must be lovely,” said Mrs. Vincy, when Lydgate mentioned his\r\n",
      "purchase with some descriptive touches. “Just what Rosy ought to have.\r\n",
      "I trust in heaven it won’t be broken!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One must hire servants who will not break things,” said Lydgate.\r\n",
      "(Certainly, this was reasoning with an imperfect vision of sequences.\r\n",
      "But at that period there was no sort of reasoning which was not more or\r\n",
      "less sanctioned by men of science.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course it was unnecessary to defer the mention of anything to mamma,\r\n",
      "who did not readily take views that were not cheerful, and being a\r\n",
      "happy wife herself, had hardly any feeling but pride in her daughter’s\r\n",
      "marriage. But Rosamond had good reasons for suggesting to Lydgate that\r\n",
      "papa should be appealed to in writing. She prepared for the arrival of\r\n",
      "the letter by walking with her papa to the warehouse the next morning,\r\n",
      "and telling him on the way that Mr. Lydgate wished to be married soon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense, my dear!” said Mr. Vincy. “What has he got to marry on?\r\n",
      "You’d much better give up the engagement. I’ve told you so pretty\r\n",
      "plainly before this. What have you had such an education for, if you\r\n",
      "are to go and marry a poor man? It’s a cruel thing for a father to\r\n",
      "see.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Lydgate is not poor, papa. He bought Mr. Peacock’s practice,\r\n",
      "which, they say, is worth eight or nine hundred a-year.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stuff and nonsense! What’s buying a practice? He might as well buy\r\n",
      "next year’s swallows. It’ll all slip through his fingers.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“On the contrary, papa, he will increase the practice. See how he has\r\n",
      "been called in by the Chettams and Casaubons.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope he knows I shan’t give anything—with this disappointment about\r\n",
      "Fred, and Parliament going to be dissolved, and machine-breaking\r\n",
      "everywhere, and an election coming on—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear papa! what can that have to do with my marriage?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A pretty deal to do with it! We may all be ruined for what I know—the\r\n",
      "country’s in that state! Some say it’s the end of the world, and be\r\n",
      "hanged if I don’t think it looks like it! Anyhow, it’s not a time for\r\n",
      "me to be drawing money out of my business, and I should wish Lydgate to\r\n",
      "know that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure he expects nothing, papa. And he has such very high\r\n",
      "connections: he is sure to rise in one way or another. He is engaged in\r\n",
      "making scientific discoveries.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy was silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot give up my only prospect of happiness, papa. Mr. Lydgate is a\r\n",
      "gentleman. I could never love any one who was not a perfect gentleman.\r\n",
      "You would not like me to go into a consumption, as Arabella Hawley did.\r\n",
      "And you know that I never change my mind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again papa was silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Promise me, papa, that you will consent to what we wish. We shall\r\n",
      "never give each other up; and you know that you have always objected to\r\n",
      "long courtships and late marriages.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a little more urgency of this kind, till Mr. Vincy said,\r\n",
      "“Well, well, child, he must write to me first before I can answer\r\n",
      "him,”—and Rosamond was certain that she had gained her point.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy’s answer consisted chiefly in a demand that Lydgate should\r\n",
      "insure his life—a demand immediately conceded. This was a delightfully\r\n",
      "reassuring idea supposing that Lydgate died, but in the mean time not a\r\n",
      "self-supporting idea. However, it seemed to make everything comfortable\r\n",
      "about Rosamond’s marriage; and the necessary purchases went on with\r\n",
      "much spirit. Not without prudential considerations, however. A bride\r\n",
      "(who is going to visit at a baronet’s) must have a few first-rate\r\n",
      "pocket-handkerchiefs; but beyond the absolutely necessary half-dozen,\r\n",
      "Rosamond contented herself without the very highest style of embroidery\r\n",
      "and Valenciennes. Lydgate also, finding that his sum of eight hundred\r\n",
      "pounds had been considerably reduced since he had come to Middlemarch,\r\n",
      "restrained his inclination for some plate of an old pattern which was\r\n",
      "shown to him when he went into Kibble’s establishment at Brassing to\r\n",
      "buy forks and spoons. He was too proud to act as if he presupposed that\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy would advance money to provide furniture; and though, since\r\n",
      "it would not be necessary to pay for everything at once, some bills\r\n",
      "would be left standing over, he did not waste time in conjecturing how\r\n",
      "much his father-in-law would give in the form of dowry, to make payment\r\n",
      "easy. He was not going to do anything extravagant, but the requisite\r\n",
      "things must be bought, and it would be bad economy to buy them of a\r\n",
      "poor quality. All these matters were by the bye. Lydgate foresaw that\r\n",
      "science and his profession were the objects he should alone pursue\r\n",
      "enthusiastically; but he could not imagine himself pursuing them in\r\n",
      "such a home as Wrench had—the doors all open, the oil-cloth worn, the\r\n",
      "children in soiled pinafores, and lunch lingering in the form of bones,\r\n",
      "black-handled knives, and willow-pattern. But Wrench had a wretched\r\n",
      "lymphatic wife who made a mummy of herself indoors in a large shawl;\r\n",
      "and he must have altogether begun with an ill-chosen domestic\r\n",
      "apparatus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond, however, was on her side much occupied with conjectures,\r\n",
      "though her quick imitative perception warned her against betraying them\r\n",
      "too crudely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall like so much to know your family,” she said one day, when the\r\n",
      "wedding journey was being discussed. “We might perhaps take a direction\r\n",
      "that would allow us to see them as we returned. Which of your uncles do\r\n",
      "you like best?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh,—my uncle Godwin, I think. He is a good-natured old fellow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You were constantly at his house at Quallingham, when you were a boy,\r\n",
      "were you not? I should so like to see the old spot and everything you\r\n",
      "were used to. Does he know you are going to be married?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Lydgate, carelessly, turning in his chair and rubbing his\r\n",
      "hair up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do send him word of it, you naughty undutiful nephew. He will perhaps\r\n",
      "ask you to take me to Quallingham; and then you could show me about the\r\n",
      "grounds, and I could imagine you there when you were a boy. Remember,\r\n",
      "you see me in my home, just as it has been since I was a child. It is\r\n",
      "not fair that I should be so ignorant of yours. But perhaps you would\r\n",
      "be a little ashamed of me. I forgot that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate smiled at her tenderly, and really accepted the suggestion that\r\n",
      "the proud pleasure of showing so charming a bride was worth some\r\n",
      "trouble. And now he came to think of it, he would like to see the old\r\n",
      "spots with Rosamond.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will write to him, then. But my cousins are bores.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It seemed magnificent to Rosamond to be able to speak so slightingly of\r\n",
      "a baronet’s family, and she felt much contentment in the prospect of\r\n",
      "being able to estimate them contemptuously on her own account.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But mamma was near spoiling all, a day or two later, by saying—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope your uncle Sir Godwin will not look down on Rosy, Mr. Lydgate.\r\n",
      "I should think he would do something handsome. A thousand or two can be\r\n",
      "nothing to a baronet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mamma!” said Rosamond, blushing deeply; and Lydgate pitied her so much\r\n",
      "that he remained silent and went to the other end of the room to\r\n",
      "examine a print curiously, as if he had been absent-minded. Mamma had a\r\n",
      "little filial lecture afterwards, and was docile as usual. But Rosamond\r\n",
      "reflected that if any of those high-bred cousins who were bores, should\r\n",
      "be induced to visit Middlemarch, they would see many things in her own\r\n",
      "family which might shock them. Hence it seemed desirable that Lydgate\r\n",
      "should by-and-by get some first-rate position elsewhere than in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch; and this could hardly be difficult in the case of a man\r\n",

      "Mr. Brooke had gone into at one time, but that he was strikingly ready\r\n",
      "at seizing the points of the political situation, and dealing with them\r\n",

      "he helped him, but he had begun to dislike him still more now that Will\r\n",
      "had declined his help. That is the way with us when we have any uneasy\r\n",
      "jealousy in our disposition: if our talents are chiefly of the\r\n",
      "burrowing kind, our honey-sipping cousin (whom we have grave reasons\r\n",
      "for objecting to) is likely to have a secret contempt for us, and any\r\n",
      "one who admires him passes an oblique criticism on ourselves. Having\r\n",
      "the scruples of rectitude in our souls, we are above the meanness of\r\n",
      "injuring him—rather we meet all his claims on us by active benefits;\r\n",
      "and the drawing of cheques for him, being a superiority which he must\r\n",
      "recognize, gives our bitterness a milder infusion. Now Mr. Casaubon had\r\n",
      "been deprived of that superiority (as anything more than a remembrance)\r\n",
      "in a sudden, capricious manner. His antipathy to Will did not spring\r\n",
      "from the common jealousy of a winter-worn husband: it was something\r\n",
      "deeper, bred by his lifelong claims and discontents; but Dorothea, now\r\n",
      "that she was present—Dorothea, as a young wife who herself had shown an\r\n",
      "offensive capability of criticism, necessarily gave concentration to\r\n",
      "the uneasiness which had before been vague.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will Ladislaw on his side felt that his dislike was flourishing at the\r\n",
      "expense of his gratitude, and spent much inward discourse in justifying\r\n",
      "the dislike. Casaubon hated him—he knew that very well; on his first\r\n",
      "entrance he could discern a bitterness in the mouth and a venom in the\r\n",
      "glance which would almost justify declaring war in spite of past\r\n",
      "benefits. He was much obliged to Casaubon in the past, but really the\r\n",
      "act of marrying this wife was a set-off against the obligation. It was\r\n",
      "a question whether gratitude which refers to what is done for one’s\r\n",
      "self ought not to give way to indignation at what is done against\r\n",
      "another. And Casaubon had done a wrong to Dorothea in marrying her. A\r\n",
      "man was bound to know himself better than that, and if he chose to grow\r\n",
      "gray crunching bones in a cavern, he had no business to be luring a\r\n",
      "girl into his companionship. “It is the most horrible of\r\n",
      "virgin-sacrifices,” said Will; and he painted to himself what were\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s inward sorrows as if he had been writing a choric wail. But\r\n",
      "he would never lose sight of her: he would watch over her—if he gave up\r\n",
      "everything else in life he would watch over her, and she should know\r\n",
      "that she had one slave in the world. Will had—to use Sir Thomas\r\n",
      "Browne’s phrase—a “passionate prodigality” of statement both to himself\r\n",
      "and others. The simple truth was that nothing then invited him so\r\n",
      "strongly as the presence of Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Invitations of the formal kind had been wanting, however, for Will had\r\n",
      "never been asked to go to Lowick. Mr. Brooke, indeed, confident of\r\n",
      "doing everything agreeable which Casaubon, poor fellow, was too much\r\n",
      "absorbed to think of, had arranged to bring Ladislaw to Lowick several\r\n",
      "times (not neglecting meanwhile to introduce him elsewhere on every\r\n",
      "opportunity as “a young relative of Casaubon’s”). And though Will had\r\n",
      "not seen Dorothea alone, their interviews had been enough to restore\r\n",
      "her former sense of young companionship with one who was cleverer than\r\n",
      "herself, yet seemed ready to be swayed by her. Poor Dorothea before her\r\n",
      "marriage had never found much room in other minds for what she cared\r\n",
      "most to say; and she had not, as we know, enjoyed her husband’s\r\n",
      "superior instruction so much as she had expected. If she spoke with any\r\n",
      "keenness of interest to Mr. Casaubon, he heard her with an air of\r\n",
      "patience as if she had given a quotation from the Delectus familiar to\r\n",
      "him from his tender years, and sometimes mentioned curtly what ancient\r\n",
      "sects or personages had held similar ideas, as if there were too much\r\n",
      "of that sort in stock already; at other times he would inform her that\r\n",
      "she was mistaken, and reassert what her remark had questioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Will Ladislaw always seemed to see more in what she said than she\r\n",
      "herself saw. Dorothea had little vanity, but she had the ardent woman’s\r\n",
      "need to rule beneficently by making the joy of another soul. Hence the\r\n",
      "mere chance of seeing Will occasionally was like a lunette opened in\r\n",
      "the wall of her prison, giving her a glimpse of the sunny air; and this\r\n",
      "pleasure began to nullify her original alarm at what her husband might\r\n",
      "think about the introduction of Will as her uncle’s guest. On this\r\n",
      "subject Mr. Casaubon had remained dumb.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Will wanted to talk with Dorothea alone, and was impatient of slow\r\n",
      "circumstance. However slight the terrestrial intercourse between Dante\r\n",
      "and Beatrice or Petrarch and Laura, time changes the proportion of\r\n",
      "things, and in later days it is preferable to have fewer sonnets and\r\n",
      "more conversation. Necessity excused stratagem, but stratagem was\r\n",
      "limited by the dread of offending Dorothea. He found out at last that\r\n",
      "he wanted to take a particular sketch at Lowick; and one morning when\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke had to drive along the Lowick road on his way to the county\r\n",
      "town, Will asked to be set down with his sketch-book and camp-stool at\r\n",
      "Lowick, and without announcing himself at the Manor settled himself to\r\n",
      "sketch in a position where he must see Dorothea if she came out to\r\n",
      "walk—and he knew that she usually walked an hour in the morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the stratagem was defeated by the weather. Clouds gathered with\r\n",
      "treacherous quickness, the rain came down, and Will was obliged to take\r\n",
      "shelter in the house. He intended, on the strength of relationship, to\r\n",
      "go into the drawing-room and wait there without being announced; and\r\n",
      "seeing his old acquaintance the butler in the hall, he said, “Don’t\r\n",
      "mention that I am here, Pratt; I will wait till luncheon; I know Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon does not like to be disturbed when he is in the library.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Master is out, sir; there’s only Mrs. Casaubon in the library. I’d\r\n",
      "better tell her you’re here, sir,” said Pratt, a red-cheeked man given\r\n",
      "to lively converse with Tantripp, and often agreeing with her that it\r\n",
      "must be dull for Madam.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, very well; this confounded rain has hindered me from sketching,”\r\n",
      "said Will, feeling so happy that he affected indifference with\r\n",
      "delightful ease.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In another minute he was in the library, and Dorothea was meeting him\r\n",
      "with her sweet unconstrained smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Casaubon has gone to the Archdeacon’s,” she said, at once. “I\r\n",
      "don’t know whether he will be at home again long before dinner. He was\r\n",
      "uncertain how long he should be. Did you want to say anything\r\n",
      "particular to him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; I came to sketch, but the rain drove me in. Else I would not have\r\n",
      "disturbed you yet. I supposed that Mr. Casaubon was here, and I know he\r\n",
      "dislikes interruption at this hour.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am indebted to the rain, then. I am so glad to see you.” Dorothea\r\n",
      "uttered these common words with the simple sincerity of an unhappy\r\n",
      "child, visited at school.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I really came for the chance of seeing you alone,” said Will,\r\n",
      "mysteriously forced to be just as simple as she was. He could not stay\r\n",
      "to ask himself, why not? “I wanted to talk about things, as we did in\r\n",
      "Rome. It always makes a difference when other people are present.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Dorothea, in her clear full tone of assent. “Sit down.” She\r\n",
      "seated herself on a dark ottoman with the brown books behind her,\r\n",
      "looking in her plain dress of some thin woollen-white material, without\r\n",
      "a single ornament on her besides her wedding-ring, as if she were under\r\n",
      "a vow to be different from all other women; and Will sat down opposite\r\n",
      "her at two yards’ distance, the light falling on his bright curls and\r\n",
      "delicate but rather petulant profile, with its defiant curves of lip\r\n",
      "and chin. Each looked at the other as if they had been two flowers\r\n",
      "which had opened then and there. Dorothea for the moment forgot her\r\n",
      "husband’s mysterious irritation against Will: it seemed fresh water at\r\n",
      "her thirsty lips to speak without fear to the one person whom she had\r\n",
      "found receptive; for in looking backward through sadness she\r\n",
      "exaggerated a past solace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have often thought that I should like to talk to you again,” she\r\n",
      "said, immediately. “It seems strange to me how many things I said to\r\n",
      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I remember them all,” said Will, with the unspeakable content in his\r\n",
      "soul of feeling that he was in the presence of a creature worthy to be\r\n",
      "perfectly loved. I think his own feelings at that moment were perfect,\r\n",
      "for we mortals have our divine moments, when love is satisfied in the\r\n",
      "completeness of the beloved object.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have tried to learn a great deal since we were in Rome,” said\r\n",
      "Dorothea. “I can read Latin a little, and I am beginning to understand\r\n",
      "just a little Greek. I can help Mr. Casaubon better now. I can find out\r\n",
      "references for him and save his eyes in many ways. But it is very\r\n",
      "difficult to be learned; it seems as if people were worn out on the way\r\n",
      "to great thoughts, and can never enjoy them because they are too\r\n",
      "tired.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If a man has a capacity for great thoughts, he is likely to overtake\r\n",
      "them before he is decrepit,” said Will, with irrepressible quickness.\r\n",
      "But through certain sensibilities Dorothea was as quick as he, and\r\n",
      "seeing her face change, he added, immediately, “But it is quite true\r\n",
      "that the best minds have been sometimes overstrained in working out\r\n",
      "their ideas.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You correct me,” said Dorothea. “I expressed myself ill. I should have\r\n",
      "said that those who have great thoughts get too much worn in working\r\n",
      "them out. I used to feel about that, even when I was a little girl; and\r\n",
      "it always seemed to me that the use I should like to make of my life\r\n",
      "would be to help some one who did great works, so that his burthen\r\n",
      "might be lighter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was led on to this bit of autobiography without any sense of\r\n",
      "making a revelation. But she had never before said anything to Will\r\n",
      "which threw so strong a light on her marriage. He did not shrug his\r\n",
      "shoulders; and for want of that muscular outlet he thought the more\r\n",
      "irritably of beautiful lips kissing holy skulls and other emptinesses\r\n",
      "ecclesiastically enshrined. Also he had to take care that his speech\r\n",
      "should not betray that thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you may easily carry the help too far,” he said, “and get\r\n",
      "over-wrought yourself. Are you not too much shut up? You already look\r\n",
      "paler. It would be better for Mr. Casaubon to have a secretary; he\r\n",
      "could easily get a man who would do half his work for him. It would\r\n",
      "save him more effectually, and you need only help him in lighter ways.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can you think of that?” said Dorothea, in a tone of earnest\r\n",
      "remonstrance. “I should have no happiness if I did not help him in his\r\n",
      "work. What could I do? There is no good to be done in Lowick. The only\r\n",
      "thing I desire is to help him more. And he objects to a secretary:\r\n",
      "please not to mention that again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly not, now I know your feeling. But I have heard both Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke and Sir James Chettam express the same wish.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Dorothea, “but they don’t understand—they want me to be a\r\n",
      "great deal on horseback, and have the garden altered and new\r\n",
      "conservatories, to fill up my days. I thought you could understand that\r\n",
      "one’s mind has other wants,” she added, rather impatiently—“besides,\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon cannot bear to hear of a secretary.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My mistake is excusable,” said Will. “In old days I used to hear Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon speak as if he looked forward to having a secretary. Indeed he\r\n",
      "held out the prospect of that office to me. But I turned out to be—not\r\n",
      "good enough for it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was trying to extract out of this an excuse for her husband’s\r\n",
      "evident repulsion, as she said, with a playful smile, “You were not a\r\n",
      "steady worker enough.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Will, shaking his head backward somewhat after the manner of\r\n",
      "a spirited horse. And then, the old irritable demon prompting him to\r\n",
      "give another good pinch at the moth-wings of poor Mr. Casaubon’s glory,\r\n",
      "he went on, “And I have seen since that Mr. Casaubon does not like any\r\n",
      "one to overlook his work and know thoroughly what he is doing. He is\r\n",
      "too doubtful—too uncertain of himself. I may not be good for much, but\r\n",
      "he dislikes me because I disagree with him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was not without his intentions to be always generous, but our\r\n",
      "tongues are little triggers which have usually been pulled before\r\n",
      "general intentions can be brought to bear. And it was too intolerable\r\n",
      "that Casaubon’s dislike of him should not be fairly accounted for to\r\n",
      "Dorothea. Yet when he had spoken he was rather uneasy as to the effect\r\n",
      "on her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Dorothea was strangely quiet—not immediately indignant, as she had\r\n",
      "been on a like occasion in Rome. And the cause lay deep. She was no\r\n",
      "longer struggling against the perception of facts, but adjusting\r\n",
      "herself to their clearest perception; and now when she looked steadily\r\n",
      "at her husband’s failure, still more at his possible consciousness of\r\n",
      "failure, she seemed to be looking along the one track where duty became\r\n",
      "tenderness. Will’s want of reticence might have been met with more\r\n",
      "severity, if he had not already been recommended to her mercy by her\r\n",
      "husband’s dislike, which must seem hard to her till she saw better\r\n",
      "reason for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She did not answer at once, but after looking down ruminatingly she\r\n",
      "said, with some earnestness, “Mr. Casaubon must have overcome his\r\n",
      "dislike of you so far as his actions were concerned: and that is\r\n",
      "admirable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; he has shown a sense of justice in family matters. It was an\r\n",
      "abominable thing that my grandmother should have been disinherited\r\n",
      "because she made what they called a _mesalliance_, though there was\r\n",
      "nothing to be said against her husband except that he was a Polish\r\n",
      "refugee who gave lessons for his bread.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish I knew all about her!” said Dorothea. “I wonder how she bore\r\n",
      "the change from wealth to poverty: I wonder whether she was happy with\r\n",
      "her husband! Do you know much about them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; only that my grandfather was a patriot—a bright fellow—could speak\r\n",
      "many languages—musical—got his bread by teaching all sorts of things.\r\n",
      "They both died rather early. And I never knew much of my father, beyond\r\n",
      "what my mother told me; but he inherited the musical talents. I\r\n",
      "remember his slow walk and his long thin hands; and one day remains\r\n",
      "with me when he was lying ill, and I was very hungry, and had only a\r\n",
      "little bit of bread.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, what a different life from mine!” said Dorothea, with keen\r\n",
      "interest, clasping her hands on her lap. “I have always had too much of\r\n",
      "everything. But tell me how it was—Mr. Casaubon could not have known\r\n",
      "about you then.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; but my father had made himself known to Mr. Casaubon, and that was\r\n",
      "my last hungry day. My father died soon after, and my mother and I were\r\n",
      "well taken care of. Mr. Casaubon always expressly recognized it as his\r\n",
      "duty to take care of us because of the harsh injustice which had been\r\n",
      "shown to his mother’s sister. But now I am telling you what is not new\r\n",
      "to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In his inmost soul Will was conscious of wishing to tell Dorothea what\r\n",
      "was rather new even in his own construction of things—namely, that Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon had never done more than pay a debt towards him. Will was much\r\n",
      "too good a fellow to be easy under the sense of being ungrateful. And\r\n",
      "when gratitude has become a matter of reasoning there are many ways of\r\n",
      "escaping from its bonds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” answered Dorothea; “Mr. Casaubon has always avoided dwelling on\r\n",
      "his own honorable actions.” She did not feel that her husband’s conduct\r\n",
      "was depreciated; but this notion of what justice had required in his\r\n",
      "relations with Will Ladislaw took strong hold on her mind. After a\r\n",
      "moment’s pause, she added, “He had never told me that he supported your\r\n",
      "mother. Is she still living?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; she died by an accident—a fall—four years ago. It is curious that\r\n",
      "my mother, too, ran away from her family, but not for the sake of her\r\n",
      "husband. She never would tell me anything about her family, except that\r\n",
      "she forsook them to get her own living—went on the stage, in fact. She\r\n",
      "was a dark-eyed creature, with crisp ringlets, and never seemed to be\r\n",
      "getting old. You see I come of rebellious blood on both sides,” Will\r\n",
      "ended, smiling brightly at Dorothea, while she was still looking with\r\n",
      "serious intentness before her, like a child seeing a drama for the\r\n",
      "first time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But her face, too, broke into a smile as she said, “That is your\r\n",
      "apology, I suppose, for having yourself been rather rebellious; I mean,\r\n",
      "to Mr. Casaubon’s wishes. You must remember that you have not done what\r\n",
      "he thought best for you. And if he dislikes you—you were speaking of\r\n",
      "dislike a little while ago—but I should rather say, if he has shown any\r\n",
      "painful feelings towards you, you must consider how sensitive he has\r\n",
      "become from the wearing effect of study. Perhaps,” she continued,\r\n",
      "getting into a pleading tone, “my uncle has not told you how serious\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon’s illness was. It would be very petty of us who are well\r\n",
      "and can bear things, to think much of small offences from those who\r\n",
      "carry a weight of trial.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You teach me better,” said Will. “I will never grumble on that subject\r\n",
      "again.” There was a gentleness in his tone which came from the\r\n",
      "unutterable contentment of perceiving—what Dorothea was hardly\r\n",
      "conscious of—that she was travelling into the remoteness of pure pity\r\n",
      "and loyalty towards her husband. Will was ready to adore her pity and\r\n",
      "loyalty, if she would associate himself with her in manifesting them.\r\n",
      "“I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow,” he went on, “but I\r\n",
      "will never again, if I can help it, do or say what you would\r\n",
      "disapprove.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is very good of you,” said Dorothea, with another open smile. “I\r\n",
      "shall have a little kingdom then, where I shall give laws. But you will\r\n",
      "soon go away, out of my rule, I imagine. You will soon be tired of\r\n",
      "staying at the Grange.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is a point I wanted to mention to you—one of the reasons why I\r\n",
      "wished to speak to you alone. Mr. Brooke proposes that I should stay in\r\n",
      "this neighborhood. He has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and\r\n",
      "he wishes me to conduct that, and also to help him in other ways.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?” said\r\n",
      "Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps; but I have always been blamed for thinking of prospects, and\r\n",
      "not settling to anything. And here is something offered to me. If you\r\n",
      "would not like me to accept it, I will give it up. Otherwise I would\r\n",
      "rather stay in this part of the country than go away. I belong to\r\n",
      "nobody anywhere else.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should like you to stay very much,” said Dorothea, at once, as\r\n",
      "simply and readily as she had spoken at Rome. There was not the shadow\r\n",
      "of a reason in her mind at the moment why she should not say so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then I _will_ stay,” said Ladislaw, shaking his head backward, rising\r\n",
      "and going towards the window, as if to see whether the rain had ceased.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the next moment, Dorothea, according to a habit which was getting\r\n",
      "continually stronger, began to reflect that her husband felt\r\n",
      "differently from herself, and she colored deeply under the double\r\n",
      "embarrassment of having expressed what might be in opposition to her\r\n",
      "husband’s feeling, and of having to suggest this opposition to Will.\r\n",
      "His face was not turned towards her, and this made it easier to say—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject. I think you\r\n",
      "should be guided by Mr. Casaubon. I spoke without thinking of anything\r\n",
      "else than my own feeling, which has nothing to do with the real\r\n",
      "question. But it now occurs to me—perhaps Mr. Casaubon might see that\r\n",
      "the proposal was not wise. Can you not wait now and mention it to him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can’t wait to-day,” said Will, inwardly seared by the possibility\r\n",
      "that Mr. Casaubon would enter. “The rain is quite over now. I told Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke not to call for me: I would rather walk the five miles. I shall\r\n",
      "strike across Halsell Common, and see the gleams on the wet grass. I\r\n",
      "like that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He approached her to shake hands quite hurriedly, longing but not\r\n",
      "daring to say, “Don’t mention the subject to Mr. Casaubon.” No, he\r\n",
      "dared not, could not say it. To ask her to be less simple and direct\r\n",
      "would be like breathing on the crystal that you want to see the light\r\n",
      "through. And there was always the other great dread—of himself becoming\r\n",
      "dimmed and forever ray-shorn in her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish you could have stayed,” said Dorothea, with a touch of\r\n",
      "mournfulness, as she rose and put out her hand. She also had her\r\n",
      "thought which she did not like to express:—Will certainly ought to lose\r\n",
      "no time in consulting Mr. Casaubon’s wishes, but for her to urge this\r\n",
      "might seem an undue dictation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they only said “Good-by,” and Will quitted the house, striking\r\n",
      "across the fields so as not to run any risk of encountering Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s carriage, which, however, did not appear at the gate until\r\n",
      "four o’clock. That was an unpropitious hour for coming home: it was too\r\n",
      "early to gain the moral support under ennui of dressing his person for\r\n",
      "dinner, and too late to undress his mind of the day’s frivolous\r\n",
      "ceremony and affairs, so as to be prepared for a good plunge into the\r\n",
      "serious business of study. On such occasions he usually threw into an\r\n",
      "easy-chair in the library, and allowed Dorothea to read the London\r\n",
      "papers to him, closing his eyes the while. To-day, however, he declined\r\n",
      "that relief, observing that he had already had too many public details\r\n",
      "urged upon him; but he spoke more cheerfully than usual, when Dorothea\r\n",
      "asked about his fatigue, and added with that air of formal effort which\r\n",
      "never forsook him even when he spoke without his waistcoat and cravat—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have had the gratification of meeting my former acquaintance, Dr.\r\n",
      "Spanning, to-day, and of being praised by one who is himself a worthy\r\n",
      "recipient of praise. He spoke very handsomely of my late tractate on\r\n",
      "the Egyptian Mysteries,—using, in fact, terms which it would not become\r\n",
      "me to repeat.” In uttering the last clause, Mr. Casaubon leaned over\r\n",
      "the elbow of his chair, and swayed his head up and down, apparently as\r\n",
      "a muscular outlet instead of that recapitulation which would not have\r\n",
      "been becoming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very glad you have had that pleasure,” said Dorothea, delighted\r\n",
      "to see her husband less weary than usual at this hour. “Before you came\r\n",
      "I had been regretting that you happened to be out to-day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why so, my dear?” said Mr. Casaubon, throwing himself backward again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because Mr. Ladislaw has been here; and he has mentioned a proposal of\r\n",
      "my uncle’s which I should like to know your opinion of.” Her husband\r\n",
      "she felt was really concerned in this question. Even with her ignorance\r\n",
      "of the world she had a vague impression that the position offered to\r\n",
      "Will was out of keeping with his family connections, and certainly Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon had a claim to be consulted. He did not speak, but merely\r\n",
      "bowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear uncle, you know, has many projects. It appears that he has bought\r\n",
      "one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and he has asked Mr. Ladislaw to\r\n",
      "stay in this neighborhood and conduct the paper for him, besides\r\n",
      "helping him in other ways.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea looked at her husband while she spoke, but he had at first\r\n",
      "blinked and finally closed his eyes, as if to save them; while his lips\r\n",
      "became more tense. “What is your opinion?” she added, rather timidly,\r\n",
      "after a slight pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did Mr. Ladislaw come on purpose to ask my opinion?” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon, opening his eyes narrowly with a knife-edged look at\r\n",
      "Dorothea. She was really uncomfortable on the point he inquired about,\r\n",
      "but she only became a little more serious, and her eyes did not swerve.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” she answered immediately, “he did not say that he came to ask\r\n",
      "your opinion. But when he mentioned the proposal, he of course expected\r\n",
      "me to tell you of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon was silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I feared that you might feel some objection. But certainly a young man\r\n",
      "with so much talent might be very useful to my uncle—might help him to\r\n",
      "do good in a better way. And Mr. Ladislaw wishes to have some fixed\r\n",
      "occupation. He has been blamed, he says, for not seeking something of\r\n",
      "that kind, and he would like to stay in this neighborhood because no\r\n",
      "one cares for him elsewhere.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt that this was a consideration to soften her husband.\r\n",
      "However, he did not speak, and she presently recurred to Dr. Spanning\r\n",
      "and the Archdeacon’s breakfast. But there was no longer sunshine on\r\n",
      "these subjects.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next morning, without Dorothea’s knowledge, Mr. Casaubon despatched\r\n",
      "the following letter, beginning “Dear Mr. Ladislaw” (he had always\r\n",
      "before addressed him as “Will”):—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Casaubon informs me that a proposal has been made to you, and\r\n",
      "(according to an inference by no means stretched) has on your part been\r\n",
      "in some degree entertained, which involves your residence in this\r\n",
      "neighborhood in a capacity which I am justified in saying touches my\r\n",
      "own position in such a way as renders it not only natural and\r\n",
      "warrantable in me when that effect is viewed under the influence of\r\n",
      "legitimate feeling, but incumbent on me when the same effect is\r\n",
      "considered in the light of my responsibilities, to state at once that\r\n",
      "your acceptance of the proposal above indicated would be highly\r\n",
      "offensive to me. That I have some claim to the exercise of a veto here,\r\n",
      "would not, I believe, be denied by any reasonable person cognizant of\r\n",
      "the relations between us: relations which, though thrown into the past\r\n",
      "by your recent procedure, are not thereby annulled in their character\r\n",
      "of determining antecedents. I will not here make reflections on any\r\n",
      "person’s judgment. It is enough for me to point out to yourself that\r\n",
      "there are certain social fitnesses and proprieties which should hinder\r\n",
      "a somewhat near relative of mine from becoming any wise conspicuous in\r\n",
      "this vicinity in a status not only much beneath my own, but associated\r\n",
      "at best with the sciolism of literary or political adventurers. At any\r\n",
      "rate, the contrary issue must exclude you from further reception at my\r\n",
      "house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yours faithfully,\r\n",
      "“EDWARD CASAUBON.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Dorothea’s mind was innocently at work towards the further\r\n",
      "embitterment of her husband; dwelling, with a sympathy that grew to\r\n",
      "agitation, on what Will had told her about his parents and\r\n",
      "grandparents. Any private hours in her day were usually spent in her\r\n",
      "blue-green boudoir, and she had come to be very fond of its pallid\r\n",
      "quaintness. Nothing had been outwardly altered there; but while the\r\n",
      "summer had gradually advanced over the western fields beyond the avenue\r\n",
      "of elms, the bare room had gathered within it those memories of an\r\n",
      "inward life which fill the air as with a cloud of good or bad angels,\r\n",
      "the invisible yet active forms of our spiritual triumphs or our\r\n",
      "spiritual falls. She had been so used to struggle for and to find\r\n",
      "resolve in looking along the avenue towards the arch of western light\r\n",
      "that the vision itself had gained a communicating power. Even the pale\r\n",
      "stag seemed to have reminding glances and to mean mutely, “Yes, we\r\n",
      "know.” And the group of delicately touched miniatures had made an\r\n",
      "audience as of beings no longer disturbed about their own earthly lot,\r\n",
      "but still humanly interested. Especially the mysterious “Aunt Julia”\r\n",
      "about whom Dorothea had never found it easy to question her husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, since her conversation with Will, many fresh images had\r\n",
      "gathered round that Aunt Julia who was Will’s grandmother; the presence\r\n",
      "of that delicate miniature, so like a living face that she knew,\r\n",
      "helping to concentrate her feelings. What a wrong, to cut off the girl\r\n",
      "from the family protection and inheritance only because she had chosen\r\n",
      "a man who was poor! Dorothea, early troubling her elders with questions\r\n",
      "about the facts around her, had wrought herself into some independent\r\n",
      "clearness as to the historical, political reasons why eldest sons had\r\n",
      "superior rights, and why land should be entailed: those reasons,\r\n",
      "impressing her with a certain awe, might be weightier than she knew,\r\n",
      "but here was a question of ties which left them uninfringed. Here was a\r\n",
      "daughter whose child—even according to the ordinary aping of\r\n",
      "aristocratic institutions by people who are no more aristocratic than\r\n",
      "retired grocers, and who have no more land to “keep together” than a\r\n",
      "lawn and a paddock—would have a prior claim. Was inheritance a question\r\n",
      "of liking or of responsibility? All the energy of Dorothea’s nature\r\n",
      "went on the side of responsibility—the fulfilment of claims founded on\r\n",
      "our own deeds, such as marriage and parentage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was true, she said to herself, that Mr. Casaubon had a debt to the\r\n",
      "Ladislaws—that he had to pay back what the Ladislaws had been wronged\r\n",
      "of. And now she began to think of her husband’s will, which had been\r\n",
      "made at the time of their marriage, leaving the bulk of his property to\r\n",
      "her, with proviso in case of her having children. That ought to be\r\n",
      "altered; and no time ought to be lost. This very question which had\r\n",
      "just arisen about Will Ladislaw’s occupation, was the occasion for\r\n",
      "placing things on a new, right footing. Her husband, she felt sure,\r\n",
      "according to all his previous conduct, would be ready to take the just\r\n",
      "view, if she proposed it—she, in whose interest an unfair concentration\r\n",
      "of the property had been urged. His sense of right had surmounted and\r\n",
      "would continue to surmount anything that might be called antipathy. She\r\n",
      "suspected that her uncle’s scheme was disapproved by Mr. Casaubon, and\r\n",
      "this made it seem all the more opportune that a fresh understanding\r\n",
      "should be begun, so that instead of Will’s starting penniless and\r\n",
      "accepting the first function that offered itself, he should find\r\n",
      "himself in possession of a rightful income which should be paid by her\r\n",
      "husband during his life, and, by an immediate alteration of the will,\r\n",
      "should be secured at his death. The vision of all this as what ought to\r\n",
      "be done seemed to Dorothea like a sudden letting in of daylight, waking\r\n",
      "her from her previous stupidity and incurious self-absorbed ignorance\r\n",
      "about her husband’s relation to others. Will Ladislaw had refused Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s future aid on a ground that no longer appeared right to her;\r\n",
      "and Mr. Casaubon had never himself seen fully what was the claim upon\r\n",
      "him. “But he will!” said Dorothea. “The great strength of his character\r\n",
      "lies here. And what are we doing with our money? We make no use of half\r\n",
      "of our income. My own money buys me nothing but an uneasy conscience.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a peculiar fascination for Dorothea in this division of\r\n",
      "property intended for herself, and always regarded by her as excessive.\r\n",
      "She was blind, you see, to many things obvious to others—likely to\r\n",
      "tread in the wrong places, as Celia had warned her; yet her blindness\r\n",
      "to whatever did not lie in her own pure purpose carried her safely by\r\n",
      "the side of precipices where vision would have been perilous with fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The thoughts which had gathered vividness in the solitude of her\r\n",
      "boudoir occupied her incessantly through the day on which Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "had sent his letter to Will. Everything seemed hindrance to her till\r\n",
      "she could find an opportunity of opening her heart to her husband. To\r\n",
      "his preoccupied mind all subjects were to be approached gently, and she\r\n",
      "had never since his illness lost from her consciousness the dread of\r\n",
      "agitating him. But when young ardor is set brooding over the conception\r\n",
      "of a prompt deed, the deed itself seems to start forth with independent\r\n",
      "life, mastering ideal obstacles. The day passed in a sombre fashion,\r\n",
      "not unusual, though Mr. Casaubon was perhaps unusually silent; but\r\n",
      "there were hours of the night which might be counted on as\r\n",
      "opportunities of conversation; for Dorothea, when aware of her\r\n",
      "husband’s sleeplessness, had established a habit of rising, lighting a\r\n",
      "candle, and reading him to sleep again. And this night she was from the\r\n",
      "beginning sleepless, excited by resolves. He slept as usual for a few\r\n",
      "hours, but she had risen softly and had sat in the darkness for nearly\r\n",
      "an hour before he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea, since you are up, will you light a candle?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you feel ill, dear?” was her first question, as she obeyed him.\r\n",

      "read me a few pages of Lowth.”\r\n",

      "hardly of him, dear. He only told me a little about his parents and\r\n",

      "of the bearing which my acceptance of occupation—not enriching\r\n",
      "certainly, but not dishonorable—will have on your own position which\r\n",

      "win Dorothea’s confidence and sow her mind with disrespect, and perhaps\r\n",

      "needed to account for Will’s sudden change of course in rejecting Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s aid and quitting his travels; and this defiant determination\r\n",
      "to fix himself in the neighborhood by taking up something so much at\r\n",
      "variance with his former choice as Mr. Brooke’s Middlemarch projects,\r\n",
      "revealed clearly enough that the undeclared motive had relation to\r\n",

      "to regard Will Ladislaw favorably and be influenced by what he said.\r\n",

      "Depend upon it, I have put my finger on the right thing.” And Mr.\r\n",

      "them know that he did not find marriage particularly blissful would\r\n",

      "expenses I could scare him. It’s no use plying him with wide words like\r\n",
      "Expenditure: I wouldn’t talk of phlebotomy, I would empty a pot of\r\n",
      "leeches upon him. What we good stingy people don’t like, is having our\r\n",
      "sixpences sucked away from us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And he will not like having things raked up against him,” said Sir\r\n",
      "James. “There is the management of his estate. They have begun upon\r\n",
      "that already. And it really is painful for me to see. It is a nuisance\r\n",
      "under one’s very nose. I do think one is bound to do the best for one’s\r\n",
      "land and tenants, especially in these hard times.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps the ‘Trumpet’ may rouse him to make a change, and some good\r\n",
      "may come of it all,” said the Rector. “I know I should be glad. I\r\n",
      "should hear less grumbling when my tithe is paid. I don’t know what I\r\n",
      "should do if there were not a modus in Tipton.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I want him to have a proper man to look after things—I want him to\r\n",
      "take on Garth again,” said Sir James. “He got rid of Garth twelve years\r\n",
      "ago, and everything has been going wrong since. I think of getting\r\n",
      "Garth to manage for me—he has made such a capital plan for my\r\n",
      "buildings; and Lovegood is hardly up to the mark. But Garth would not\r\n",
      "undertake the Tipton estate again unless Brooke left it entirely to\r\n",
      "him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the right of it too,” said the Rector. “Garth is an independent\r\n",
      "fellow: an original, simple-minded fellow. One day, when he was doing\r\n",
      "some valuation for me, he told me point-blank that clergymen seldom\r\n",
      "understood anything about business, and did mischief when they meddled;\r\n",
      "but he said it as quietly and respectfully as if he had been talking to\r\n",
      "me about sailors. He would make a different parish of Tipton, if Brooke\r\n",
      "would let him manage. I wish, by the help of the ‘Trumpet,’ you could\r\n",
      "bring that round.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If Dorothea had kept near her uncle, there would have been some\r\n",
      "chance,” said Sir James. “She might have got some power over him in\r\n",
      "time, and she was always uneasy about the estate. She had wonderfully\r\n",
      "good notions about such things. But now Casaubon takes her up entirely.\r\n",
      "Celia complains a good deal. We can hardly get her to dine with us,\r\n",
      "since he had that fit.” Sir James ended with a look of pitying disgust,\r\n",
      "and Mrs. Cadwallader shrugged her shoulders as much as to say that\r\n",
      "_she_ was not likely to see anything new in that direction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor Casaubon!” the Rector said. “That was a nasty attack. I thought\r\n",
      "he looked shattered the other day at the Archdeacon’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In point of fact,” resumed Sir James, not choosing to dwell on “fits,”\r\n",
      "“Brooke doesn’t mean badly by his tenants or any one else, but he has\r\n",
      "got that way of paring and clipping at expenses.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, that’s a blessing,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “That helps him to\r\n",
      "find himself in a morning. He may not know his own opinions, but he\r\n",
      "does know his own pocket.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t believe a man is in pocket by stinginess on his land,” said\r\n",
      "Sir James.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, stinginess may be abused like other virtues: it will not do to\r\n",
      "keep one’s own pigs lean,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who had risen to look\r\n",
      "out of the window. “But talk of an independent politician and he will\r\n",
      "appear.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! Brooke?” said her husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes. Now, you ply him with the ‘Trumpet,’ Humphrey; and I will put the\r\n",
      "leeches on him. What will you do, Sir James?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The fact is, I don’t like to begin about it with Brooke, in our mutual\r\n",
      "position; the whole thing is so unpleasant. I do wish people would\r\n",
      "behave like gentlemen,” said the good baronet, feeling that this was a\r\n",
      "simple and comprehensive programme for social well-being.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here you all are, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, shuffling round and shaking\r\n",
      "hands. “I was going up to the Hall by-and-by, Chettam. But it’s\r\n",
      "pleasant to find everybody, you know. Well, what do you think of\r\n",
      "things?—going on a little fast! It was true enough, what Lafitte\r\n",
      "said—‘Since yesterday, a century has passed away:’—they’re in the next\r\n",
      "century, you know, on the other side of the water. Going on faster than\r\n",
      "we are.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, yes,” said the Rector, taking up the newspaper. “Here is the\r\n",
      "‘Trumpet’ accusing you of lagging behind—did you see?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Eh? no,” said Mr. Brooke, dropping his gloves into his hat and hastily\r\n",
      "adjusting his eye-glass. But Mr. Cadwallader kept the paper in his\r\n",
      "hand, saying, with a smile in his eyes—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here! all this is about a landlord not a hundred miles from\r\n",
      "Middlemarch, who receives his own rents. They say he is the most\r\n",
      "retrogressive man in the county. I think you must have taught them that\r\n",
      "word in the ‘Pioneer.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, that is Keck—an illiterate fellow, you know. Retrogressive, now!\r\n",
      "Come, that’s capital. He thinks it means destructive: they want to make\r\n",
      "me out a destructive, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with that\r\n",
      "cheerfulness which is usually sustained by an adversary’s ignorance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think he knows the meaning of the word. Here is a sharp stroke or\r\n",
      "two. _If we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil\r\n",
      "sense of the word—we should say, he is one who would dub himself a\r\n",
      "reformer of our constitution, while every interest for which he is\r\n",
      "immediately responsible is going to decay: a philanthropist who cannot\r\n",
      "bear one rogue to be hanged, but does not mind five honest tenants\r\n",
      "being half-starved: a man who shrieks at corruption, and keeps his\r\n",
      "farms at rack-rent: who roars himself red at rotten boroughs, and does\r\n",
      "not mind if every field on his farms has a rotten gate: a man very\r\n",
      "open-hearted to Leeds and Manchester, no doubt; he would give any\r\n",
      "number of representatives who will pay for their seats out of their own\r\n",
      "pockets: what he objects to giving, is a little return on rent-days to\r\n",
      "help a tenant to buy stock, or an outlay on repairs to keep the weather\r\n",
      "out at a tenant’s barn-door or make his house look a little less like\r\n",
      "an Irish cottier’s. But we all know the wag’s definition of a\r\n",
      "philanthropist: a man whose charity increases directly as the square of\r\n",
      "the distance._ And so on. All the rest is to show what sort of\r\n",
      "legislator a philanthropist is likely to make,” ended the Rector,\r\n",
      "throwing down the paper, and clasping his hands at the back of his\r\n",
      "head, while he looked at Mr. Brooke with an air of amused neutrality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, that’s rather good, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the\r\n",
      "paper and trying to bear the attack as easily as his neighbor did, but\r\n",
      "coloring and smiling rather nervously; “that about roaring himself red\r\n",
      "at rotten boroughs—I never made a speech about rotten boroughs in my\r\n",
      "life. And as to roaring myself red and that kind of thing—these men\r\n",
      "never understand what is good satire. Satire, you know, should be true\r\n",
      "up to a certain point. I recollect they said that in ‘The Edinburgh’\r\n",
      "somewhere—it must be true up to a certain point.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that is really a hit about the gates,” said Sir James, anxious\r\n",
      "to tread carefully. “Dagley complained to me the other day that he\r\n",
      "hadn’t got a decent gate on his farm. Garth has invented a new pattern\r\n",
      "of gate—I wish you would try it. One ought to use some of one’s timber\r\n",
      "in that way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You go in for fancy farming, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\n",
      "appearing to glance over the columns of the “Trumpet.” “That’s your\r\n",
      "hobby, and you don’t mind the expense.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought the most expensive hobby in the world was standing for\r\n",
      "Parliament,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “They said the last unsuccessful\r\n",
      "candidate at Middlemarch—Giles, wasn’t his name?—spent ten thousand\r\n",
      "pounds and failed because he did not bribe enough. What a bitter\r\n",
      "reflection for a man!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Somebody was saying,” said the Rector, laughingly, “that East Retford\r\n",
      "was nothing to Middlemarch, for bribery.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing of the kind,” said Mr. Brooke. “The Tories bribe, you know:\r\n",
      "Hawley and his set bribe with treating, hot codlings, and that sort of\r\n",
      "thing; and they bring the voters drunk to the poll. But they are not\r\n",
      "going to have it their own way in future—not in future, you know.\r\n",
      "Middlemarch is a little backward, I admit—the freemen are a little\r\n",
      "backward. But we shall educate them—we shall bring them on, you know.\r\n",
      "The best people there are on our side.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hawley says you have men on your side who will do you harm,” remarked\r\n",
      "Sir James. “He says Bulstrode the banker will do you harm.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And that if you got pelted,” interposed Mrs. Cadwallader, “half the\r\n",
      "rotten eggs would mean hatred of your committee-man. Good heavens!\r\n",
      "Think what it must be to be pelted for wrong opinions. And I seem to\r\n",
      "remember a story of a man they pretended to chair and let him fall into\r\n",
      "a dust-heap on purpose!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pelting is nothing to their finding holes in one’s coat,” said the\r\n",
      "Rector. “I confess that’s what I should be afraid of, if we parsons had\r\n",
      "to stand at the hustings for preferment. I should be afraid of their\r\n",
      "reckoning up all my fishing days. Upon my word, I think the truth is\r\n",
      "the hardest missile one can be pelted with.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The fact is,” said Sir James, “if a man goes into public life he must\r\n",
      "be prepared for the consequences. He must make himself proof against\r\n",
      "calumny.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Chettam, that is all very fine, you know,” said Mr. Brooke.\r\n",
      "“But how will you make yourself proof against calumny? You should read\r\n",
      "history—look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of\r\n",
      "thing. They always happen to the best men, you know. But what is that\r\n",
      "in Horace?—_fiat justitia, ruat_ … something or other.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Exactly,” said Sir James, with a little more heat than usual. “What I\r\n",
      "mean by being proof against calumny is being able to point to the fact\r\n",
      "as a contradiction.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And it is not martyrdom to pay bills that one has run into one’s\r\n",
      "self,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was Sir James’s evident annoyance that most stirred Mr. Brooke.\r\n",
      "“Well, you know, Chettam,” he said, rising, taking up his hat and\r\n",
      "leaning on his stick, “you and I have a different system. You are all\r\n",
      "for outlay with your farms. I don’t want to make out that my system is\r\n",
      "good under all circumstances—under all circumstances, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There ought to be a new valuation made from time to time,” said Sir\r\n",
      "James. “Returns are very well occasionally, but I like a fair\r\n",
      "valuation. What do you say, Cadwallader?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I agree with you. If I were Brooke, I would choke the ‘Trumpet’ at\r\n",
      "once by getting Garth to make a new valuation of the farms, and giving\r\n",
      "him _carte blanche_ about gates and repairs: that’s my view of the\r\n",
      "political situation,” said the Rector, broadening himself by sticking\r\n",
      "his thumbs in his armholes, and laughing towards Mr. Brooke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s a showy sort of thing to do, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “But I\r\n",
      "should like you to tell me of another landlord who has distressed his\r\n",
      "tenants for arrears as little as I have. I let the old tenants stay on.\r\n",
      "I’m uncommonly easy, let me tell you, uncommonly easy. I have my own\r\n",
      "ideas, and I take my stand on them, you know. A man who does that is\r\n",
      "always charged with eccentricity, inconsistency, and that kind of\r\n",
      "thing. When I change my line of action, I shall follow my own ideas.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After that, Mr. Brooke remembered that there was a packet which he had\r\n",
      "omitted to send off from the Grange, and he bade everybody hurriedly\r\n",
      "good-by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I didn’t want to take a liberty with Brooke,” said Sir James; “I see\r\n",
      "he is nettled. But as to what he says about old tenants, in point of\r\n",
      "fact no new tenant would take the farms on the present terms.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have a notion that he will be brought round in time,” said the\r\n",
      "Rector. “But you were pulling one way, Elinor, and we were pulling\r\n",
      "another. You wanted to frighten him away from expense, and we want to\r\n",
      "frighten him into it. Better let him try to be popular and see that his\r\n",
      "character as a landlord stands in his way. I don’t think it signifies\r\n",
      "two straws about the ‘Pioneer,’ or Ladislaw, or Brooke’s speechifying\r\n",

      "observing him would have seen a change in his complexion, in the\r\n",

      "“He only feels confident that you will do it,” said Dorothea, in a\r\n",
      "voice as clear and unhesitating as that of a young chorister chanting a\r\n",
      "credo, “because you mean to enter Parliament as a member who cares for\r\n",
      "the improvement of the people, and one of the first things to be made\r\n",
      "better is the state of the land and the laborers. Think of Kit Downes,\r\n",
      "uncle, who lives with his wife and seven children in a house with one\r\n",
      "sitting room and one bedroom hardly larger than this table!—and those\r\n",
      "poor Dagleys, in their tumble-down farmhouse, where they live in the\r\n",
      "back kitchen and leave the other rooms to the rats! That is one reason\r\n",
      "why I did not like the pictures here, dear uncle—which you think me\r\n",
      "stupid about. I used to come from the village with all that dirt and\r\n",
      "coarse ugliness like a pain within me, and the simpering pictures in\r\n",
      "the drawing-room seemed to me like a wicked attempt to find delight in\r\n",
      "what is false, while we don’t mind how hard the truth is for the\r\n",
      "neighbors outside our walls. I think we have no right to come forward\r\n",
      "and urge wider changes for good, until we have tried to alter the evils\r\n",
      "which lie under our own hands.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea had gathered emotion as she went on, and had forgotten\r\n",
      "everything except the relief of pouring forth her feelings, unchecked:\r\n",
      "an experience once habitual with her, but hardly ever present since her\r\n",
      "marriage, which had been a perpetual struggle of energy with fear. For\r\n",
      "the moment, Will’s admiration was accompanied with a chilling sense of\r\n",
      "remoteness. A man is seldom ashamed of feeling that he cannot love a\r\n",
      "woman so well when he sees a certain greatness in her: nature having\r\n",
      "intended greatness for men. But nature has sometimes made sad\r\n",
      "oversights in carrying out her intention; as in the case of good Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke, whose masculine consciousness was at this moment in rather a\r\n",
      "stammering condition under the eloquence of his niece. He could not\r\n",
      "immediately find any other mode of expressing himself than that of\r\n",
      "rising, fixing his eye-glass, and fingering the papers before him. At\r\n",
      "last he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is something in what you say, my dear, something in what you\r\n",
      "say—but not everything—eh, Ladislaw? You and I don’t like our pictures\r\n",
      "and statues being found fault with. Young ladies are a little ardent,\r\n",
      "you know—a little one-sided, my dear. Fine art, poetry, that kind of\r\n",
      "thing, elevates a nation—_emollit mores_—you understand a little Latin\r\n",
      "now. But—eh? what?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These interrogatives were addressed to the footman who had come in to\r\n",
      "say that the keeper had found one of Dagley’s boys with a leveret in\r\n",
      "his hand just killed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll come, I’ll come. I shall let him off easily, you know,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke aside to Dorothea, shuffling away very cheerfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope you feel how right this change is that I—that Sir James wishes\r\n",
      "for,” said Dorothea to Will, as soon as her uncle was gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do, now I have heard you speak about it. I shall not forget what you\r\n",
      "have said. But can you think of something else at this moment? I may\r\n",
      "not have another opportunity of speaking to you about what has\r\n",
      "occurred,” said Will, rising with a movement of impatience, and holding\r\n",
      "the back of his chair with both hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray tell me what it is,” said Dorothea, anxiously, also rising and\r\n",
      "going to the open window, where Monk was looking in, panting and\r\n",
      "wagging his tail. She leaned her back against the window-frame, and\r\n",
      "laid her hand on the dog’s head; for though, as we know, she was not\r\n",
      "fond of pets that must be held in the hands or trodden on, she was\r\n",
      "always attentive to the feelings of dogs, and very polite if she had to\r\n",
      "decline their advances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will followed her only with his eyes and said, “I presume you know that\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon has forbidden me to go to his house.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I did not,” said Dorothea, after a moment’s pause. She was\r\n",
      "evidently much moved. “I am very, very sorry,” she added, mournfully.\r\n",
      "She was thinking of what Will had no knowledge of—the conversation\r\n",
      "between her and her husband in the darkness; and she was anew smitten\r\n",
      "with hopelessness that she could influence Mr. Casaubon’s action. But\r\n",
      "the marked expression of her sorrow convinced Will that it was not all\r\n",
      "given to him personally, and that Dorothea had not been visited by the\r\n",
      "idea that Mr. Casaubon’s dislike and jealousy of him turned upon\r\n",
      "herself. He felt an odd mixture of delight and vexation: of delight\r\n",
      "that he could dwell and be cherished in her thought as in a pure home,\r\n",
      "without suspicion and without stint—of vexation because he was of too\r\n",
      "little account with her, was not formidable enough, was treated with an\r\n",
      "unhesitating benevolence which did not flatter him. But his dread of\r\n",
      "any change in Dorothea was stronger than his discontent, and he began\r\n",
      "to speak again in a tone of mere explanation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Casaubon’s reason is, his displeasure at my taking a position here\r\n",
      "which he considers unsuited to my rank as his cousin. I have told him\r\n",
      "that I cannot give way on this point. It is a little too hard on me to\r\n",
      "expect that my course in life is to be hampered by prejudices which I\r\n",
      "think ridiculous. Obligation may be stretched till it is no better than\r\n",
      "a brand of slavery stamped on us when we were too young to know its\r\n",
      "meaning. I would not have accepted the position if I had not meant to\r\n",
      "make it useful and honorable. I am not bound to regard family dignity\r\n",
      "in any other light.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt wretched. She thought her husband altogether in the\r\n",
      "wrong, on more grounds than Will had mentioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is better for us not to speak on the subject,” she said, with a\r\n",
      "tremulousness not common in her voice, “since you and Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "disagree. You intend to remain?” She was looking out on the lawn, with\r\n",
      "melancholy meditation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; but I shall hardly ever see you now,” said Will, in a tone of\r\n",
      "almost boyish complaint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Dorothea, turning her eyes full upon him, “hardly ever. But\r\n",
      "I shall hear of you. I shall know what you are doing for my uncle.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall know hardly anything about you,” said Will. “No one will tell\r\n",
      "me anything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, my life is very simple,” said Dorothea, her lips curling with an\r\n",
      "exquisite smile, which irradiated her melancholy. “I am always at\r\n",
      "Lowick.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is a dreadful imprisonment,” said Will, impetuously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, don’t think that,” said Dorothea. “I have no longings.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not speak, but she replied to some change in his expression. “I\r\n",
      "mean, for myself. Except that I should like not to have so much more\r\n",
      "than my share without doing anything for others. But I have a belief of\r\n",
      "my own, and it comforts me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is that?” said Will, rather jealous of the belief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don’t quite know\r\n",
      "what it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power\r\n",
      "against evil—widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with\r\n",
      "darkness narrower.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is a beautiful mysticism—it is a—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Please not to call it by any name,” said Dorothea, putting out her\r\n",
      "hands entreatingly. “You will say it is Persian, or something else\r\n",
      "geographical. It is my life. I have found it out, and cannot part with\r\n",
      "it. I have always been finding out my religion since I was a little\r\n",
      "girl. I used to pray so much—now I hardly ever pray. I try not to have\r\n",
      "desires merely for myself, because they may not be good for others, and\r\n",
      "I have too much already. I only told you, that you might know quite\r\n",
      "well how my days go at Lowick.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God bless you for telling me!” said Will, ardently, and rather\r\n",
      "wondering at himself. They were looking at each other like two fond\r\n",
      "children who were talking confidentially of birds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is _your_ religion?” said Dorothea. “I mean—not what you know\r\n",
      "about religion, but the belief that helps you most?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To love what is good and beautiful when I see it,” said Will. “But I\r\n",
      "am a rebel: I don’t feel bound, as you do, to submit to what I don’t\r\n",
      "like.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But if you like what is good, that comes to the same thing,” said\r\n",
      "Dorothea, smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now you are subtle,” said Will.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; Mr. Casaubon often says I am too subtle. I don’t feel as if I\r\n",
      "were subtle,” said Dorothea, playfully. “But how long my uncle is! I\r\n",
      "must go and look for him. I must really go on to the Hall. Celia is\r\n",
      "expecting me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will offered to tell Mr. Brooke, who presently came and said that he\r\n",
      "would step into the carriage and go with Dorothea as far as Dagley’s,\r\n",
      "to speak about the small delinquent who had been caught with the\r\n",
      "leveret. Dorothea renewed the subject of the estate as they drove\r\n",
      "along, but Mr. Brooke, not being taken unawares, got the talk under his\r\n",
      "own control.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Chettam, now,” he replied; “he finds fault with me, my dear; but I\r\n",
      "should not preserve my game if it were not for Chettam, and he can’t\r\n",
      "say that that expense is for the sake of the tenants, you know. It’s a\r\n",
      "little against my feeling:—poaching, now, if you come to look into it—I\r\n",
      "have often thought of getting up the subject. Not long ago, Flavell,\r\n",
      "the Methodist preacher, was brought up for knocking down a hare that\r\n",
      "came across his path when he and his wife were walking out together. He\r\n",
      "was pretty quick, and knocked it on the neck.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was very brutal, I think,” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, now, it seemed rather black to me, I confess, in a Methodist\r\n",
      "preacher, you know. And Johnson said, ‘You may judge what a hypo_crite_\r\n",
      "he is.’ And upon my word, I thought Flavell looked very little like\r\n",
      "‘the highest style of man’—as somebody calls the Christian—Young, the\r\n",
      "poet Young, I think—you know Young? Well, now, Flavell in his shabby\r\n",
      "black gaiters, pleading that he thought the Lord had sent him and his\r\n",
      "wife a good dinner, and he had a right to knock it down, though not a\r\n",
      "mighty hunter before the Lord, as Nimrod was—I assure you it was rather\r\n",
      "comic: Fielding would have made something of it—or Scott, now—Scott\r\n",
      "might have worked it up. But really, when I came to think of it, I\r\n",
      "couldn’t help liking that the fellow should have a bit of hare to say\r\n",
      "grace over. It’s all a matter of prejudice—prejudice with the law on\r\n",
      "its side, you know—about the stick and the gaiters, and so on. However,\r\n",
      "it doesn’t do to reason about things; and law is law. But I got Johnson\r\n",
      "to be quiet, and I hushed the matter up. I doubt whether Chettam would\r\n",
      "not have been more severe, and yet he comes down on me as if I were the\r\n",
      "hardest man in the county. But here we are at Dagley’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke got down at a farmyard-gate, and Dorothea drove on. It is\r\n",
      "wonderful how much uglier things will look when we only suspect that we\r\n",
      "are blamed for them. Even our own persons in the glass are apt to\r\n",
      "change their aspect for us after we have heard some frank remark on\r\n",
      "their less admirable points; and on the other hand it is astonishing\r\n",
      "how pleasantly conscience takes our encroachments on those who never\r\n",
      "complain or have nobody to complain for them. Dagley’s homestead never\r\n",
      "before looked so dismal to Mr. Brooke as it did today, with his mind\r\n",
      "thus sore about the fault-finding of the “Trumpet,” echoed by Sir\r\n",
      "James.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is true that an observer, under that softening influence of the fine\r\n",
      "arts which makes other people’s hardships picturesque, might have been\r\n",
      "delighted with this homestead called Freeman’s End: the old house had\r\n",
      "dormer-windows in the dark red roof, two of the chimneys were choked\r\n",
      "with ivy, the large porch was blocked up with bundles of sticks, and\r\n",
      "half the windows were closed with gray worm-eaten shutters about which\r\n",
      "the jasmine-boughs grew in wild luxuriance; the mouldering garden wall\r\n",
      "with hollyhocks peeping over it was a perfect study of highly mingled\r\n",
      "subdued color, and there was an aged goat (kept doubtless on\r\n",
      "interesting superstitious grounds) lying against the open back-kitchen\r\n",
      "door. The mossy thatch of the cow-shed, the broken gray barn-doors, the\r\n",
      "pauper laborers in ragged breeches who had nearly finished unloading a\r\n",
      "wagon of corn into the barn ready for early thrashing; the scanty dairy\r\n",
      "of cows being tethered for milking and leaving one half of the shed in\r\n",
      "brown emptiness; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to wander about\r\n",
      "the uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from feeding on a too\r\n",
      "meagre quality of rinsings,—all these objects under the quiet light of\r\n",
      "a sky marbled with high clouds would have made a sort of picture which\r\n",
      "we have all paused over as a “charming bit,” touching other\r\n",
      "sensibilities than those which are stirred by the depression of the\r\n",
      "agricultural interest, with the sad lack of farming capital, as seen\r\n",
      "constantly in the newspapers of that time. But these troublesome\r\n",
      "associations were just now strongly present to Mr. Brooke, and spoiled\r\n",
      "the scene for him. Mr. Dagley himself made a figure in the landscape,\r\n",
      "carrying a pitchfork and wearing his milking-hat—a very old beaver\r\n",
      "flattened in front. His coat and breeches were the best he had, and he\r\n",
      "would not have been wearing them on this weekday occasion if he had not\r\n",
      "been to market and returned later than usual, having given himself the\r\n",
      "rare treat of dining at the public table of the Blue Bull. How he came\r\n",
      "to fall into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of wonderment to\r\n",
      "himself on the morrow; but before dinner something in the state of the\r\n",
      "country, a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips were cut,\r\n",
      "the stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on the walls,\r\n",
      "had seemed to warrant a little recklessness. It was a maxim about\r\n",
      "Middlemarch, and regarded as self-evident, that good meat should have\r\n",
      "good drink, which last Dagley interpreted as plenty of table ale well\r\n",
      "followed up by rum-and-water. These liquors have so far truth in them\r\n",
      "that they were not false enough to make poor Dagley seem merry: they\r\n",
      "only made his discontent less tongue-tied than usual. He had also taken\r\n",
      "too much in the shape of muddy political talk, a stimulant dangerously\r\n",
      "disturbing to his farming conservatism, which consisted in holding that\r\n",
      "whatever is, is bad, and any change is likely to be worse. He was\r\n",
      "flushed, and his eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as he stood\r\n",
      "still grasping his pitchfork, while the landlord approached with his\r\n",
      "easy shuffling walk, one hand in his trouser-pocket and the other\r\n",
      "swinging round a thin walking-stick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dagley, my good fellow,” began Mr. Brooke, conscious that he was going\r\n",
      "to be very friendly about the boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, ay, I’m a good feller, am I? Thank ye, sir, thank ye,” said\r\n",
      "Dagley, with a loud snarling irony which made Fag the sheep-dog stir\r\n",
      "from his seat and prick his ears; but seeing Monk enter the yard after\r\n",
      "some outside loitering, Fag seated himself again in an attitude of\r\n",
      "observation. “I’m glad to hear I’m a good feller.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke reflected that it was market-day, and that his worthy tenant\r\n",
      "had probably been dining, but saw no reason why he should not go on,\r\n",
      "since he could take the precaution of repeating what he had to say to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Dagley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your little lad Jacob has been caught killing a leveret, Dagley: I\r\n",
      "have told Johnson to lock him up in the empty stable an hour or two,\r\n",
      "just to frighten him, you know. But he will be brought home by-and-by,\r\n",
      "before night: and you’ll just look after him, will you, and give him a\r\n",
      "reprimand, you know?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I woon’t: I’ll be dee’d if I’ll leather my boy to please you or\r\n",

      "came to tell you about your boy: I don’t want you to give him the\r\n",
      "stick, you know.” He was careful to speak quite plainly this time.\r\n",

      "so entirely vanished that she had not even any Sunday clothes which\r\n",
      "could give her satisfaction in preparing for church—had already had a\r\n",
      "misunderstanding with her husband since he had come home, and was in\r\n",
      "low spirits, expecting the worst. But her husband was beforehand in\r\n",
      "answering.\r\n",

      "“No, nor he woon’t hev the stick, whether you want it or no,” pursued\r\n",
      "Dagley, throwing out his voice, as if he wanted it to hit hard. “You’ve\r\n",
      "got no call to come an’ talk about sticks o’ these primises, as you\r\n",

      "added, turning as if to go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Dagley immediately fronted him, and Fag at his heels growled low,\r\n",
      "as his master’s voice grew louder and more insulting, while Monk also\r\n",
      "drew close in silent dignified watch. The laborers on the wagon were\r\n",
      "pausing to listen, and it seemed wiser to be quite passive than to\r\n",
      "attempt a ridiculous flight pursued by a bawling man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m no more drunk nor you are, nor so much,” said Dagley. “I can carry\r\n",

      "hope you’re the better for knowin’ him, I arn’t.’ Says they, ‘He’s a\r\n",
      "close-fisted un.’ ‘Ay ay,’ says I. ‘He’s a man for the Rinform,’ says\r\n",
      "they. That’s what they says. An’ I made out what the Rinform were—an’\r\n",
      "it were to send you an’ your likes a-scuttlin’ an’ wi’ pretty\r\n",

      "firmness which proved inconvenient as he tried to draw it up again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this last action Monk began to bark loudly, and it was a moment for\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke to escape. He walked out of the yard as quickly as he could,\r\n",
      "in some amazement at the novelty of his situation. He had never been\r\n",
      "insulted on his own land before, and had been inclined to regard\r\n",
      "himself as a general favorite (we are all apt to do so, when we think\r\n",
      "of our own amiability more than of what other people are likely to want\r\n",
      "of us). When he had quarrelled with Caleb Garth twelve years before he\r\n",
      "had thought that the tenants would be pleased at the landlord’s taking\r\n",
      "everything into his own hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some who follow the narrative of his experience may wonder at the\r\n",
      "midnight darkness of Mr. Dagley; but nothing was easier in those times\r\n",
      "than for an hereditary farmer of his grade to be ignorant, in spite\r\n",
      "somehow of having a rector in the twin parish who was a gentleman to\r\n",
      "the backbone, a curate nearer at hand who preached more learnedly than\r\n",
      "the rector, a landlord who had gone into everything, especially fine\r\n",
      "art and social improvement, and all the lights of Middlemarch only\r\n",
      "three miles off. As to the facility with which mortals escape\r\n",
      "knowledge, try an average acquaintance in the intellectual blaze of\r\n",
      "London, and consider what that eligible person for a dinner-party would\r\n",
      "have been if he had learned scant skill in “summing” from the\r\n",
      "parish-clerk of Tipton, and read a chapter in the Bible with immense\r\n",
      "difficulty, because such names as Isaiah or Apollos remained\r\n",
      "unmanageable after twice spelling. Poor Dagley read a few verses\r\n",
      "sometimes on a Sunday evening, and the world was at least not darker to\r\n",
      "him than it had been before. Some things he knew thoroughly, namely,\r\n",
      "the slovenly habits of farming, and the awkwardness of weather, stock\r\n",
      "and crops, at Freeman’s End—so called apparently by way of sarcasm, to\r\n",

      "was set up. The group I am moving towards is at Caleb Garth’s\r\n",
      "breakfast-table in the large parlor where the maps and desk were:\r\n",
      "father, mother, and five of the children. Mary was just now at home\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The letters had come—nine costly letters, for which the postman had\r\n",
      "been paid three and twopence, and Mr. Garth was forgetting his tea and\r\n",
      "toast while he read his letters and laid them open one above the other,\r\n",
      "sometimes swaying his head slowly, sometimes screwing up his mouth in\r\n",
      "inward debate, but not forgetting to cut off a large red seal unbroken,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The talk among the rest went on unrestrainedly, for nothing disturbed\r\n",
      "Caleb’s absorption except shaking the table when he was writing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two letters of the nine had been for Mary. After reading them, she had\r\n",
      "passed them to her mother, and sat playing with her tea-spoon absently,\r\n",
      "till with a sudden recollection she returned to her sewing, which she\r\n",
      "had kept on her lap during breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, don’t sew, Mary!” said Ben, pulling her arm down. “Make me a\r\n",
      "peacock with this bread-crumb.” He had been kneading a small mass for\r\n",
      "the purpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, Mischief!” said Mary, good-humoredly, while she pricked his\r\n",
      "hand lightly with her needle. “Try and mould it yourself: you have seen\r\n",
      "me do it often enough. I must get this sewing done. It is for Rosamond\r\n",
      "Vincy: she is to be married next week, and she can’t be married without\r\n",
      "this handkerchief.” Mary ended merrily, amused with the last notion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why can’t she, Mary?” said Letty, seriously interested in this\r\n",
      "mystery, and pushing her head so close to her sister that Mary now\r\n",
      "turned the threatening needle towards Letty’s nose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because this is one of a dozen, and without it there would only be\r\n",
      "eleven,” said Mary, with a grave air of explanation, so that Letty sank\r\n",
      "back with a sense of knowledge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you made up your mind, my dear?” said Mrs. Garth, laying the\r\n",
      "letters down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall go to the school at York,” said Mary. “I am less unfit to\r\n",
      "teach in a school than in a family. I like to teach classes best. And,\r\n",
      "you see, I must teach: there is nothing else to be done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Teaching seems to me the most delightful work in the world,” said Mrs.\r\n",

      "disliked children.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose we never quite understand why another dislikes what we like,\r\n",
      "mother,” said Mary, rather curtly. “I am not fond of a schoolroom: I\r\n",

      "mine.”\r\n",

      "two.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "throw nor leap. I don’t wonder at Mary’s not liking it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is that Mary doesn’t like, eh?” said the father, looking over his\r\n",
      "spectacles and pausing before he opened his next letter.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, father: the school at York. I have determined to take it. It is\r\n",
      "quite the best. Thirty-five pounds a-year, and extra pay for teaching\r\n",
      "the smallest strummers at the piano.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor child! I wish she could stay at home with us, Susan,” said Caleb,\r\n",
      "looking plaintively at his wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mary would not be happy without doing her duty,” said Mrs. Garth,\r\n",

      "“It wouldn’t make me happy to do such a nasty duty as that,” said\r\n",
      "Alfred—at which Mary and her father laughed silently, but Mrs. Garth\r\n",
      "said, gravely—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do find a fitter word than nasty, my dear Alfred, for everything that\r\n",
      "you think disagreeable. And suppose that Mary could help you to go to\r\n",
      "Mr. Hanmer’s with the money she gets?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That seems to me a great shame. But she’s an old brick,” said Alfred,\r\n",
      "rising from his chair, and pulling Mary’s head backward to kiss her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary colored and laughed, but could not conceal that the tears were\r\n",
      "coming. Caleb, looking on over his spectacles, with the angles of his\r\n",
      "eyebrows falling, had an expression of mingled delight and sorrow as he\r\n",
      "returned to the opening of his letter; and even Mrs. Garth, her lips\r\n",
      "curling with a calm contentment, allowed that inappropriate language to\r\n",
      "pass without correction, although Ben immediately took it up, and sang,\r\n",
      "“She’s an old brick, old brick, old brick!” to a cantering measure,\r\n",
      "which he beat out with his fist on Mary’s arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mrs. Garth’s eyes were now drawn towards her husband, who was\r\n",
      "already deep in the letter he was reading. His face had an expression\r\n",
      "of grave surprise, which alarmed her a little, but he did not like to\r\n",
      "be questioned while he was reading, and she remained anxiously watching\r\n",
      "till she saw him suddenly shaken by a little joyous laugh as he turned\r\n",
      "back to the beginning of the letter, and looking at her above his\r\n",
      "spectacles, said, in a low tone, “What do you think, Susan?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She went and stood behind him, putting her hand on his shoulder, while\r\n",
      "they read the letter together. It was from Sir James Chettam, offering\r\n",
      "to Mr. Garth the management of the family estates at Freshitt and\r\n",
      "elsewhere, and adding that Sir James had been requested by Mr. Brooke\r\n",
      "of Tipton to ascertain whether Mr. Garth would be disposed at the same\r\n",
      "time to resume the agency of the Tipton property. The Baronet added in\r\n",
      "very obliging words that he himself was particularly desirous of seeing\r\n",
      "the Freshitt and Tipton estates under the same management, and he hoped\r\n",
      "to be able to show that the double agency might be held on terms\r\n",
      "agreeable to Mr. Garth, whom he would be glad to see at the Hall at\r\n",
      "twelve o’clock on the following day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He writes handsomely, doesn’t he, Susan?” said Caleb, turning his eyes\r\n",
      "upward to his wife, who raised her hand from his shoulder to his ear,\r\n",
      "while she rested her chin on his head. “Brooke didn’t like to ask me\r\n",
      "himself, I can see,” he continued, laughing silently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here is an honor to your father, children,” said Mrs. Garth, looking\r\n",
      "round at the five pair of eyes, all fixed on the parents. “He is asked\r\n",
      "to take a post again by those who dismissed him long ago. That shows\r\n",
      "that he did his work well, so that they feel the want of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Like Cincinnatus—hooray!” said Ben, riding on his chair, with a\r\n",
      "pleasant confidence that discipline was relaxed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will they come to fetch him, mother?” said Letty, thinking of the\r\n",
      "Mayor and Corporation in their robes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth patted Letty’s head and smiled, but seeing that her husband\r\n",
      "was gathering up his letters and likely soon to be out of reach in that\r\n",
      "sanctuary “business,” she pressed his shoulder and said emphatically—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, mind you ask fair pay, Caleb.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes,” said Caleb, in a deep voice of assent, as if it would be\r\n",
      "unreasonable to suppose anything else of him. “It’ll come to between\r\n",
      "four and five hundred, the two together.” Then with a little start of\r\n",
      "remembrance he said, “Mary, write and give up that school. Stay and\r\n",
      "help your mother. I’m as pleased as Punch, now I’ve thought of that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No manner could have been less like that of Punch triumphant than\r\n",
      "Caleb’s, but his talents did not lie in finding phrases, though he was\r\n",
      "very particular about his letter-writing, and regarded his wife as a\r\n",
      "treasury of correct language.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was almost an uproar among the children now, and Mary held up the\r\n",
      "cambric embroidery towards her mother entreatingly, that it might be\r\n",
      "put out of reach while the boys dragged her into a dance. Mrs. Garth,\r\n",
      "in placid joy, began to put the cups and plates together, while Caleb\r\n",
      "pushing his chair from the table, as if he were going to move to the\r\n",
      "desk, still sat holding his letters in his hand and looking on the\r\n",
      "ground meditatively, stretching out the fingers of his left hand,\r\n",
      "according to a mute language of his own. At last he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a thousand pities Christy didn’t take to business, Susan. I shall\r\n",
      "want help by-and-by. And Alfred must go off to the engineering—I’ve\r\n",
      "made up my mind to that.” He fell into meditation and finger-rhetoric\r\n",
      "again for a little while, and then continued: “I shall make Brooke have\r\n",
      "new agreements with the tenants, and I shall draw up a rotation of\r\n",
      "crops. And I’ll lay a wager we can get fine bricks out of the clay at\r\n",
      "Bott’s corner. I must look into that: it would cheapen the repairs.\r\n",
      "It’s a fine bit of work, Susan! A man without a family would be glad to\r\n",
      "do it for nothing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mind you don’t, though,” said his wife, lifting up her finger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no; but it’s a fine thing to come to a man when he’s seen into the\r\n",
      "nature of business: to have the chance of getting a bit of the country\r\n",
      "into good fettle, as they say, and putting men into the right way with\r\n",
      "their farming, and getting a bit of good contriving and solid building\r\n",
      "done—that those who are living and those who come after will be the\r\n",
      "better for. I’d sooner have it than a fortune. I hold it the most\r\n",
      "honorable work that is.” Here Caleb laid down his letters, thrust his\r\n",
      "fingers between the buttons of his waistcoat, and sat upright, but\r\n",
      "presently proceeded with some awe in his voice and moving his head\r\n",
      "slowly aside—“It’s a great gift of God, Susan.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That it is, Caleb,” said his wife, with answering fervor. “And it will\r\n",
      "be a blessing to your children to have had a father who did such work:\r\n",
      "a father whose good work remains though his name may be forgotten.” She\r\n",
      "could not say any more to him then about the pay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the evening, when Caleb, rather tired with his day’s work, was\r\n",
      "seated in silence with his pocket-book open on his knee, while Mrs.\r\n",
      "Garth and Mary were at their sewing, and Letty in a corner was\r\n",
      "whispering a dialogue with her doll, Mr. Farebrother came up the\r\n",
      "orchard walk, dividing the bright August lights and shadows with the\r\n",
      "tufted grass and the apple-tree boughs. We know that he was fond of his\r\n",
      "parishioners the Garths, and had thought Mary worth mentioning to\r\n",
      "Lydgate. He used to the full the clergyman’s privilege of disregarding\r\n",
      "the Middlemarch discrimination of ranks, and always told his mother\r\n",
      "that Mrs. Garth was more of a lady than any matron in the town. Still,\r\n",
      "you see, he spent his evenings at the Vincys’, where the matron, though\r\n",
      "less of a lady, presided over a well-lit drawing-room and whist. In\r\n",
      "those days human intercourse was not determined solely by respect. But\r\n",
      "the Vicar did heartily respect the Garths, and a visit from him was no\r\n",
      "surprise to that family. Nevertheless he accounted for it even while he\r\n",
      "was shaking hands, by saying, “I come as an envoy, Mrs. Garth: I have\r\n",
      "something to say to you and Garth on behalf of Fred Vincy. The fact is,\r\n",
      "poor fellow,” he continued, as he seated himself and looked round with\r\n",
      "his bright glance at the three who were listening to him, “he has taken\r\n",
      "me into his confidence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary’s heart beat rather quickly: she wondered how far Fred’s\r\n",
      "confidence had gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We haven’t seen the lad for months,” said Caleb. “I couldn’t think\r\n",
      "what was become of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has been away on a visit,” said the Vicar, “because home was a\r\n",
      "little too hot for him, and Lydgate told his mother that the poor\r\n",
      "fellow must not begin to study yet. But yesterday he came and poured\r\n",
      "himself out to me. I am very glad he did, because I have seen him grow\r\n",
      "up from a youngster of fourteen, and I am so much at home in the house\r\n",
      "that the children are like nephews and nieces to me. But it is a\r\n",
      "difficult case to advise upon. However, he has asked me to come and\r\n",
      "tell you that he is going away, and that he is so miserable about his\r\n",
      "debt to you, and his inability to pay, that he can’t bear to come\r\n",
      "himself even to bid you good by.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell him it doesn’t signify a farthing,” said Caleb, waving his hand.\r\n",
      "“We’ve had the pinch and have got over it. And now I’m going to be as\r\n",
      "rich as a Jew.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which means,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at the Vicar, “that we are\r\n",
      "going to have enough to bring up the boys well and to keep Mary at\r\n",
      "home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is the treasure-trove?” said Mr. Farebrother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m going to be agent for two estates, Freshitt and Tipton; and\r\n",
      "perhaps for a pretty little bit of land in Lowick besides: it’s all the\r\n",
      "same family connection, and employment spreads like water if it’s once\r\n",
      "set going. It makes me very happy, Mr. Farebrother”—here Caleb threw\r\n",
      "back his head a little, and spread his arms on the elbows of his\r\n",
      "chair—“that I’ve got an opportunity again with the letting of the land,\r\n",
      "and carrying out a notion or two with improvements. It’s a most\r\n",
      "uncommonly cramping thing, as I’ve often told Susan, to sit on\r\n",
      "horseback and look over the hedges at the wrong thing, and not be able\r\n",
      "to put your hand to it to make it right. What people do who go into\r\n",
      "politics I can’t think: it drives me almost mad to see mismanagement\r\n",

      "good deal on the injury he had done you in causing you to part with\r\n",
      "money—robbing you of it, he said—which you wanted for other purposes. I\r\n",

      "before term. I have advised him to do that. I don’t urge him to enter\r\n",
      "the Church—on the contrary. But if he will go and work so as to pass,\r\n",
      "that will be some guarantee that he has energy and a will; and he is\r\n",
      "quite at sea; he doesn’t know what else to do. So far he will please\r\n",
      "his father, and I have promised in the mean time to try and reconcile\r\n",
      "Vincy to his son’s adopting some other line of life. Fred says frankly\r\n",
      "he is not fit for a clergyman, and I would do anything I could to\r\n",
      "hinder a man from the fatal step of choosing the wrong profession. He\r\n",
      "quoted to me what you said, Miss Garth—do you remember it?” (Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother used to say “Mary” instead of “Miss Garth,” but it was part\r\n",
      "of his delicacy to treat her with the more deference because, according\r\n",
      "to Mrs. Vincy’s phrase, she worked for her bread.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary felt uncomfortable, but, determined to take the matter lightly,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You said, according to him, that he would be one of those ridiculous\r\n",

      "was so cutting that I felt a little cut myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "some enjoyment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not its flippancy, father,” said Mary, quickly, fearing that her\r\n",
      "mother would be displeased. “It is rather too bad of Fred to repeat my\r\n",
      "flippant speeches to Mr. Farebrother.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was certainly a hasty speech, my dear,” said Mrs. Garth, with whom\r\n",
      "speaking evil of dignities was a high misdemeanor. “We should not value\r\n",
      "our Vicar the less because there was a ridiculous curate in the next\r\n",
      "parish.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s something in what she says, though,” said Caleb, not disposed\r\n",
      "to have Mary’s sharpness undervalued. “A bad workman of any sort makes\r\n",
      "his fellows mistrusted. Things hang together,” he added, looking on the\r\n",
      "floor and moving his feet uneasily with a sense that words were\r\n",
      "scantier than thoughts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Clearly,” said the Vicar, amused. “By being contemptible we set men’s\r\n",
      "minds to the tune of contempt. I certainly agree with Miss Garth’s view\r\n",
      "of the matter, whether I am condemned by it or not. But as to Fred\r\n",
      "Vincy, it is only fair he should be excused a little: old\r\n",
      "Featherstone’s delusive behavior did help to spoil him. There was\r\n",
      "something quite diabolical in not leaving him a farthing after all. But\r\n",
      "Fred has the good taste not to dwell on that. And what he cares most\r\n",
      "about is having offended you, Mrs. Garth; he supposes you will never\r\n",
      "think well of him again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have been disappointed in Fred,” said Mrs. Garth, with decision.\r\n",
      "“But I shall be ready to think well of him again when he gives me good\r\n",
      "reason to do so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this point Mary went out of the room, taking Letty with her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, we must forgive young people when they’re sorry,” said Caleb,\r\n",
      "watching Mary close the door. “And as you say, Mr. Farebrother, there\r\n",
      "was the very devil in that old man. Now Mary’s gone out, I must tell\r\n",
      "you a thing—it’s only known to Susan and me, and you’ll not tell it\r\n",
      "again. The old scoundrel wanted Mary to burn one of the wills the very\r\n",
      "night he died, when she was sitting up with him by herself, and he\r\n",
      "offered her a sum of money that he had in the box by him if she would\r\n",
      "do it. But Mary, you understand, could do no such thing—would not be\r\n",
      "handling his iron chest, and so on. Now, you see, the will he wanted\r\n",
      "burnt was this last, so that if Mary had done what he wanted, Fred\r\n",
      "Vincy would have had ten thousand pounds. The old man did turn to him\r\n",
      "at the last. That touches poor Mary close; she couldn’t help it—she was\r\n",
      "in the right to do what she did, but she feels, as she says, much as if\r\n",
      "she had knocked down somebody’s property and broken it against her\r\n",
      "will, when she was rightfully defending herself. I feel with her,\r\n",
      "somehow, and if I could make any amends to the poor lad, instead of\r\n",
      "bearing him a grudge for the harm he did us, I should be glad to do it.\r\n",
      "Now, what is your opinion, sir? Susan doesn’t agree with me; she\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Mary could not have acted otherwise, even if she had known what would\r\n",

      "looking at Mr. Farebrother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And she was quite ignorant of it. It seems to me, a loss which falls\r\n",
      "on another because we have done right is not to lie upon our\r\n",
      "conscience.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Vicar did not answer immediately, and Caleb said, “It’s the\r\n",
      "feeling. The child feels in that way, and I feel with her. You don’t\r\n",
      "mean your horse to tread on a dog when you’re backing out of the way;\r\n",
      "but it goes through you, when it’s done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure Mrs. Garth would agree with you there,” said Mr.\r\n",

      "to speak. “One could hardly say that the feeling you mention about Fred\r\n",

      "such feeling.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Farebrother left the house soon after, and seeing Mary in the\r\n",
      "orchard with Letty, went to say good-by to her. They made a pretty\r\n",
      "picture in the western light which brought out the brightness of the\r\n",
      "apples on the old scant-leaved boughs—Mary in her lavender gingham and\r\n",
      "black ribbons holding a basket, while Letty in her well-worn nankin\r\n",
      "picked up the fallen apples. If you want to know more particularly how\r\n",
      "Mary looked, ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded\r\n",
      "street to-morrow, if you are there on the watch: she will not be among\r\n",
      "those daughters of Zion who are haughty, and walk with stretched-out\r\n",

      "your eyes on some small plump brownish person of firm but quiet\r\n",
      "carriage, who looks about her, but does not suppose that anybody is\r\n",
      "looking at her. If she has a broad face and square brow, well-marked\r\n",
      "eyebrows and curly dark hair, a certain expression of amusement in her\r\n",
      "glance which her mouth keeps the secret of, and for the rest features\r\n",
      "entirely insignificant—take that ordinary but not disagreeable person\r\n",
      "for a portrait of Mary Garth. If you made her smile, she would show you\r\n",
      "perfect little teeth; if you made her angry, she would not raise her\r\n",
      "voice, but would probably say one of the bitterest things you have ever\r\n",
      "tasted the flavor of; if you did her a kindness, she would never forget\r\n",
      "it. Mary admired the keen-faced handsome little Vicar in his\r\n",
      "well-brushed threadbare clothes more than any man she had had the\r\n",
      "opportunity of knowing. She had never heard him say a foolish thing,\r\n",
      "though she knew that he did unwise ones; and perhaps foolish sayings\r\n",
      "were more objectionable to her than any of Mr. Farebrother’s unwise\r\n",

      "scorn and dislike which she showed beforehand for the predicted\r\n",
      "imperfections of the clerical character sustained by Fred Vincy. These\r\n",
      "irregularities of judgment, I imagine, are found even in riper minds\r\n",
      "than Mary Garth’s: our impartiality is kept for abstract merit and\r\n",
      "demerit, which none of us ever saw. Will any one guess towards which of\r\n",
      "those widely different men Mary had the peculiar woman’s\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Mary, shaking her head, and smiling. “If I were to say that\r\n",

      "usually a fine temperament and much tolerance towards the smaller\r\n",

      "dialogue in which he told himself that there was probably something\r\n",
      "more between Fred and Mary Garth than the regard of old playfellows,\r\n",
      "and replied with a question whether that bit of womanhood were not a\r\n",
      "great deal too choice for that crude young gentleman. The rejoinder to\r\n",
      "this was the first shrug. Then he laughed at himself for being likely\r\n",
      "to have felt jealous, as if he had been a man able to marry, which,\r\n",
      "added he, it is as clear as any balance-sheet that I am not. Whereupon\r\n",

      "dangerous encouragement given them by Society to confide in their want\r\n",
      "of beauty). A human being in this aged nation of ours is a very\r\n",

      "Peter had secretly chuckled over an offshoot almost more calculating,\r\n",
      "and far more imperturbable, than himself. I will add that his\r\n",
      "finger-nails were scrupulously attended to, and that he meant to marry\r\n",
      "a well-educated young lady (as yet unspecified) whose person was good,\r\n",
      "and whose connections, in a solid middle-class way, were undeniable.\r\n",
      "Thus his nails and modesty were comparable to those of most gentlemen;\r\n",

      "their turn regarded his “bringing up” in a seaport town as an\r\n",

      "The garden and gravel approach, as seen from the two windows of the\r\n",

      "out on these grounds as their master. But it seemed doubtful whether he\r\n",
      "looked out for the sake of contemplation or of turning his back to a\r\n",

      "apart and his hands in his trouser-pockets: a person in all respects a\r\n",

      "towards sixty, very florid and hairy, with much gray in his bushy\r\n",
      "whiskers and thick curly hair, a stoutish body which showed to\r\n",
      "disadvantage the somewhat worn joinings of his clothes, and the air of\r\n",
      "a swaggerer, who would aim at being noticeable even at a show of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Then just listen to me. The more you say anything, the less I shall\r\n",
      "believe it. The more you want me to do a thing, the more reason I shall\r\n",

      "pocket everything, and going off again leaving us in the lurch? I\r\n",
      "should be glad to see you whipped at the cart-tail. My mother was a\r\n",
      "fool to you: she’d no right to give me a father-in-law, and she’s been\r\n",
      "punished for it. She shall have her weekly allowance paid and no more:\r\n",
      "and that shall be stopped if you dare to come on to these premises\r\n",
      "again, or to come into this country after me again. The next time you\r\n",

      "kickable boy, and Raffles was the rather thick-set Adonis of bar-rooms\r\n",
      "and back-parlors. But the advantage now was on the side of Rigg, and\r\n",
      "auditors of this conversation might probably have expected that Raffles\r\n",
      "would retire with the air of a defeated dog. Not at all. He made a\r\n",
      "grimace which was habitual with him whenever he was “out” in a game;\r\n",
      "then subsided into a laugh, and drew a brandy-flask from his pocket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, Josh,” he said, in a cajoling tone, “give us a spoonful of\r\n",
      "brandy, and a sovereign to pay the way back, and I’ll go. Honor bright!\r\n",
      "I’ll go like a bullet, _by_ Jove!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mind,” said Rigg, drawing out a bunch of keys, “if I ever see you\r\n",
      "again, I shan’t speak to you. I don’t own you any more than if I saw a\r\n",
      "crow; and if you want to own me you’ll get nothing by it but a\r\n",
      "character for being what you are—a spiteful, brassy, bullying rogue.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s a pity, now, Josh,” said Raffles, affecting to scratch his head\r\n",
      "and wrinkle his brows upward as if he were nonplussed. “I’m very fond\r\n",
      "of you; _by_ Jove, I am! There’s nothing I like better than plaguing\r\n",
      "you—you’re so like your mother, and I must do without it. But the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He jerked forward the flask and Rigg went to a fine old oaken bureau\r\n",
      "with his keys. But Raffles had reminded himself by his movement with\r\n",
      "the flask that it had become dangerously loose from its leather\r\n",
      "covering, and catching sight of a folded paper which had fallen within\r\n",
      "the fender, he took it up and shoved it under the leather so as to make\r\n",
      "the glass firm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By that time Rigg came forward with a brandy-bottle, filled the flask,\r\n",
      "and handed Raffles a sovereign, neither looking at him nor speaking to\r\n",
      "him. After locking up the bureau again, he walked to the window and\r\n",
      "gazed out as impassibly as he had done at the beginning of the\r\n",
      "interview, while Raffles took a small allowance from the flask, screwed\r\n",
      "it up, and deposited it in his side-pocket, with provoking slowness,\r\n",
      "making a grimace at his stepson’s back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Farewell, Josh—and if forever!” said Raffles, turning back his head as\r\n",
      "he opened the door.\r\n",

      "grassy borders of the by-roads, and hastened the laborers who were\r\n",

      "of a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country journeying on foot,\r\n",
      "looked as incongruous amid this moist rural quiet and industry as if he\r\n",

      "stare at him except the long-weaned calves, and none to show dislike of\r\n",

      "consciousness of the author—one knows of the river by a few streaks\r\n",
      "amid a long-gathered deposit of uncomfortable mud. That was the way\r\n",

      "something more troublesome than he had conceived. She nursed him, she\r\n",

      "predominating bitterness. Suspicion and jealousy of Will Ladislaw’s\r\n",
      "intentions, suspicion and jealousy of Dorothea’s impressions, were\r\n",
      "constantly at their weaving work. It would be quite unjust to him to\r\n",

      "jealous of was her opinion, the sway that might be given to her ardent\r\n",
      "mind in its judgments, and the future possibilities to which these\r\n",
      "might lead her. As to Will, though until his last defiant letter he had\r\n",
      "nothing definite which he would choose formally to allege against him,\r\n",
      "he felt himself warranted in believing that he was capable of any\r\n",
      "design which could fascinate a rebellious temper and an undisciplined\r\n",
      "impulsiveness. He was quite sure that Dorothea was the cause of Will’s\r\n",
      "return from Rome, and his determination to settle in the neighborhood;\r\n",
      "and he was penetrating enough to imagine that Dorothea had innocently\r\n",
      "encouraged this course. It was as clear as possible that she was ready\r\n",
      "to be attached to Will and to be pliant to his suggestions: they had\r\n",
      "never had a _tête-à-tête_ without her bringing away from it some new\r\n",
      "troublesome impression, and the last interview that Mr. Casaubon was\r\n",
      "aware of (Dorothea, on returning from Freshitt Hall, had for the first\r\n",
      "time been silent about having seen Will) had led to a scene which\r\n",
      "roused an angrier feeling against them both than he had ever known\r\n",
      "before. Dorothea’s outpouring of her notions about money, in the\r\n",
      "darkness of the night, had done nothing but bring a mixture of more\r\n",
      "odious foreboding into her husband’s mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And there was the shock lately given to his health always sadly present\r\n",
      "with him. He was certainly much revived; he had recovered all his usual\r\n",
      "power of work: the illness might have been mere fatigue, and there\r\n",
      "might still be twenty years of achievement before him, which would\r\n",
      "justify the thirty years of preparation. That prospect was made the\r\n",
      "sweeter by a flavor of vengeance against the hasty sneers of Carp &\r\n",
      "Company; for even when Mr. Casaubon was carrying his taper among the\r\n",
      "tombs of the past, those modern figures came athwart the dim light, and\r\n",
      "interrupted his diligent exploration. To convince Carp of his mistake,\r\n",
      "so that he would have to eat his own words with a good deal of\r\n",
      "indigestion, would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship,\r\n",
      "which the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all\r\n",
      "eternity in heaven could not exclude from contemplation. Since, thus,\r\n",
      "the prevision of his own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter\r\n",
      "savors of irritated jealousy and vindictiveness, it is the less\r\n",
      "surprising that the probability of a transient earthly bliss for other\r\n",
      "persons, when he himself should have entered into glory, had not a\r\n",
      "potently sweetening effect. If the truth should be that some\r\n",

      "opportunity for some people to be the happier when he was gone; and if\r\n",

      "disembodied existence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "his conduct than those of jealousy and vindictiveness. The way in which\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon put the case was this:—“In marrying Dorothea Brooke I had\r\n",
      "to care for her well-being in case of my death. But well-being is not\r\n",
      "to be secured by ample, independent possession of property; on the\r\n",
      "contrary, occasions might arise in which such possession might expose\r\n",
      "her to the more danger. She is ready prey to any man who knows how to\r\n",
      "play adroitly either on her affectionate ardor or her Quixotic\r\n",
      "enthusiasm; and a man stands by with that very intention in his mind—a\r\n",
      "man with no other principle than transient caprice, and who has a\r\n",
      "personal animosity towards me—I am sure of it—an animosity which is fed\r\n",
      "by the consciousness of his ingratitude, and which he has constantly\r\n",
      "vented in ridicule of which I am as well assured as if I had heard it.\r\n",
      "Even if I live I shall not be without uneasiness as to what he may\r\n",
      "attempt through indirect influence. This man has gained Dorothea’s ear:\r\n",
      "he has fascinated her attention; he has evidently tried to impress her\r\n",
      "mind with the notion that he has claims beyond anything I have done for\r\n",
      "him. If I die—and he is waiting here on the watch for that—he will\r\n",
      "persuade her to marry him. That would be calamity for her and success\r\n",
      "for him. _She_ would not think it calamity: he would make her believe\r\n",
      "anything; she has a tendency to immoderate attachment which she\r\n",
      "inwardly reproaches me for not responding to, and already her mind is\r\n",
      "occupied with his fortunes. He thinks of an easy conquest and of\r\n",
      "entering into my nest. That I will hinder! Such a marriage would be\r\n",
      "fatal to Dorothea. Has he ever persisted in anything except from\r\n",
      "contradiction? In knowledge he has always tried to be showy at small\r\n",
      "cost. In religion he could be, as long as it suited him, the facile\r\n",
      "echo of Dorothea’s vagaries. When was sciolism ever dissociated from\r\n",
      "laxity? I utterly distrust his morals, and it is my duty to hinder to\r\n",
      "the utmost the fulfilment of his designs.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The arrangements made by Mr. Casaubon on his marriage left strong\r\n",
      "measures open to him, but in ruminating on them his mind inevitably\r\n",
      "dwelt so much on the probabilities of his own life that the longing to\r\n",
      "get the nearest possible calculation had at last overcome his proud\r\n",
      "reticence, and had determined him to ask Lydgate’s opinion as to the\r\n",
      "nature of his illness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had mentioned to Dorothea that Lydgate was coming by appointment at\r\n",
      "half-past three, and in answer to her anxious question, whether he had\r\n",
      "felt ill, replied,—“No, I merely wish to have his opinion concerning\r\n",
      "some habitual symptoms. You need not see him, my dear. I shall give\r\n",
      "orders that he may be sent to me in the Yew-tree Walk, where I shall be\r\n",
      "taking my usual exercise.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Lydgate entered the Yew-tree Walk he saw Mr. Casaubon slowly\r\n",
      "receding with his hands behind him according to his habit, and his head\r\n",
      "bent forward. It was a lovely afternoon; the leaves from the lofty\r\n",
      "limes were falling silently across the sombre evergreens, while the\r\n",
      "lights and shadows slept side by side: there was no sound but the\r\n",
      "cawing of the rooks, which to the accustomed ear is a lullaby, or that\r\n",
      "last solemn lullaby, a dirge. Lydgate, conscious of an energetic frame\r\n",
      "in its prime, felt some compassion when the figure which he was likely\r\n",
      "soon to overtake turned round, and in advancing towards him showed more\r\n",
      "markedly than ever the signs of premature age—the student’s bent\r\n",
      "shoulders, the emaciated limbs, and the melancholy lines of the mouth.\r\n",
      "“Poor fellow,” he thought, “some men with his years are like lions; one\r\n",
      "can tell nothing of their age except that they are full grown.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, with his invariably polite air, “I am\r\n",
      "exceedingly obliged to you for your punctuality. We will, if you\r\n",
      "please, carry on our conversation in walking to and fro.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope your wish to see me is not due to the return of unpleasant\r\n",
      "symptoms,” said Lydgate, filling up a pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not immediately—no. In order to account for that wish I must\r\n",
      "mention—what it were otherwise needless to refer to—that my life, on\r\n",
      "all collateral accounts insignificant, derives a possible importance\r\n",
      "from the incompleteness of labors which have extended through all its\r\n",
      "best years. In short, I have long had on hand a work which I would fain\r\n",
      "leave behind me in such a state, at least, that it might be committed\r\n",
      "to the press by—others. Were I assured that this is the utmost I can\r\n",
      "reasonably expect, that assurance would be a useful circumscription of\r\n",
      "my attempts, and a guide in both the positive and negative\r\n",
      "determination of my course.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here Mr. Casaubon paused, removed one hand from his back and thrust it\r\n",
      "between the buttons of his single-breasted coat. To a mind largely\r\n",
      "instructed in the human destiny hardly anything could be more\r\n",
      "interesting than the inward conflict implied in his formal measured\r\n",
      "address, delivered with the usual sing-song and motion of the head.\r\n",
      "Nay, are there many situations more sublimely tragic than the struggle\r\n",
      "of the soul with the demand to renounce a work which has been all the\r\n",
      "significance of its life—a significance which is to vanish as the\r\n",
      "waters which come and go where no man has need of them? But there was\r\n",
      "nothing to strike others as sublime about Mr. Casaubon, and Lydgate,\r\n",
      "who had some contempt at hand for futile scholarship, felt a little\r\n",
      "amusement mingling with his pity. He was at present too ill acquainted\r\n",
      "with disaster to enter into the pathos of a lot where everything is\r\n",
      "below the level of tragedy except the passionate egoism of the\r\n",
      "sufferer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You refer to the possible hindrances from want of health?” he said,\r\n",
      "wishing to help forward Mr. Casaubon’s purpose, which seemed to be\r\n",
      "clogged by some hesitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do. You have not implied to me that the symptoms which—I am bound to\r\n",
      "testify—you watched with scrupulous care, were those of a fatal\r\n",
      "disease. But were it so, Mr. Lydgate, I should desire to know the truth\r\n",
      "without reservation, and I appeal to you for an exact statement of your\r\n",
      "conclusions: I request it as a friendly service. If you can tell me\r\n",
      "that my life is not threatened by anything else than ordinary\r\n",
      "casualties, I shall rejoice, on grounds which I have already indicated.\r\n",
      "If not, knowledge of the truth is even more important to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then I can no longer hesitate as to my course,” said Lydgate; “but the\r\n",
      "first thing I must impress on you is that my conclusions are doubly\r\n",
      "uncertain—uncertain not only because of my fallibility, but because\r\n",
      "diseases of the heart are eminently difficult to found predictions on.\r\n",
      "In any case, one can hardly increase appreciably the tremendous\r\n",
      "uncertainty of life.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon winced perceptibly, but bowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe that you are suffering from what is called fatty\r\n",
      "degeneration of the heart, a disease which was first divined and\r\n",
      "explored by Laennec, the man who gave us the stethoscope, not so very\r\n",
      "many years ago. A good deal of experience—a more lengthened\r\n",
      "observation—is wanting on the subject. But after what you have said, it\r\n",
      "is my duty to tell you that death from this disease is often sudden. At\r\n",
      "the same time, no such result can be predicted. Your condition may be\r\n",
      "consistent with a tolerably comfortable life for another fifteen years,\r\n",
      "or even more. I could add no information to this beyond anatomical or\r\n",
      "medical details, which would leave expectation at precisely the same\r\n",
      "point.” Lydgate’s instinct was fine enough to tell him that plain\r\n",
      "speech, quite free from ostentatious caution, would be felt by Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon as a tribute of respect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thank you, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon, after a moment’s pause.\r\n",
      "“One thing more I have still to ask: did you communicate what you have\r\n",
      "now told me to Mrs. Casaubon?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Partly—I mean, as to the possible issues.” Lydgate was going to\r\n",
      "explain why he had told Dorothea, but Mr. Casaubon, with an\r\n",
      "unmistakable desire to end the conversation, waved his hand slightly,\r\n",
      "and said again, “I thank you,” proceeding to remark on the rare beauty\r\n",
      "of the day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate, certain that his patient wished to be alone, soon left him;\r\n",
      "and the black figure with hands behind and head bent forward continued\r\n",
      "to pace the walk where the dark yew-trees gave him a mute companionship\r\n",
      "in melancholy, and the little shadows of bird or leaf that fleeted\r\n",
      "across the isles of sunlight, stole along in silence as in the presence\r\n",
      "of a sorrow. Here was a man who now for the first time found himself\r\n",
      "looking into the eyes of death—who was passing through one of those\r\n",
      "rare moments of experience when we feel the truth of a commonplace,\r\n",
      "which is as different from what we call knowing it, as the vision of\r\n",
      "waters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the\r\n",
      "water which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue. When the\r\n",
      "commonplace “We must all die” transforms itself suddenly into the acute\r\n",
      "consciousness “I must die—and soon,” then death grapples us, and his\r\n",
      "fingers are cruel; afterwards, he may come to fold us in his arms as\r\n",
      "our mother did, and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be\r\n",
      "like the first. To Mr. Casaubon now, it was as if he suddenly found\r\n",
      "himself on the dark river-brink and heard the plash of the oncoming\r\n",
      "oar, not discerning the forms, but expecting the summons. In such an\r\n",
      "hour the mind does not change its lifelong bias, but carries it onward\r\n",
      "in imagination to the other side of death, gazing backward—perhaps with\r\n",
      "the divine calm of beneficence, perhaps with the petty anxieties of\r\n",
      "self-assertion. What was Mr. Casaubon’s bias his acts will give us a\r\n",
      "clew to. He held himself to be, with some private scholarly\r\n",
      "reservations, a believing Christian, as to estimates of the present and\r\n",
      "hopes of the future. But what we strive to gratify, though we may call\r\n",
      "it a distant hope, is an immediate desire: the future estate for which\r\n",
      "men drudge up city alleys exists already in their imagination and love.\r\n",
      "And Mr. Casaubon’s immediate desire was not for divine communion and\r\n",
      "light divested of earthly conditions; his passionate longings, poor\r\n",
      "man, clung low and mist-like in very shady places.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea had been aware when Lydgate had ridden away, and she had\r\n",
      "stepped into the garden, with the impulse to go at once to her husband.\r\n",
      "But she hesitated, fearing to offend him by obtruding herself; for her\r\n",
      "ardor, continually repulsed, served, with her intense memory, to\r\n",
      "heighten her dread, as thwarted energy subsides into a shudder; and she\r\n",
      "wandered slowly round the nearer clumps of trees until she saw him\r\n",
      "advancing. Then she went towards him, and might have represented a\r\n",
      "heaven-sent angel coming with a promise that the short hours remaining\r\n",
      "should yet be filled with that faithful love which clings the closer to\r\n",
      "a comprehended grief. His glance in reply to hers was so chill that she\r\n",
      "felt her timidity increased; yet she turned and passed her hand through\r\n",
      "his arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon kept his hands behind him and allowed her pliant arm to\r\n",
      "cling with difficulty against his rigid arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was something horrible to Dorothea in the sensation which this\r\n",
      "unresponsive hardness inflicted on her. That is a strong word, but not\r\n",
      "too strong: it is in these acts called trivialities that the seeds of\r\n",
      "joy are forever wasted, until men and women look round with haggard\r\n",
      "faces at the devastation their own waste has made, and say, the earth\r\n",
      "bears no harvest of sweetness—calling their denial knowledge. You may\r\n",
      "ask why, in the name of manliness, Mr. Casaubon should have behaved in\r\n",
      "that way. Consider that his was a mind which shrank from pity: have you\r\n",
      "ever watched in such a mind the effect of a suspicion that what is\r\n",
      "pressing it as a grief may be really a source of contentment, either\r\n",
      "actual or future, to the being who already offends by pitying? Besides,\r\n",
      "he knew little of Dorothea’s sensations, and had not reflected that on\r\n",
      "such an occasion as the present they were comparable in strength to his\r\n",
      "own sensibilities about Carp’s criticisms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea did not withdraw her arm, but she could not venture to speak.\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon did not say, “I wish to be alone,” but he directed his\r\n",
      "steps in silence towards the house, and as they entered by the glass\r\n",
      "door on this eastern side, Dorothea withdrew her arm and lingered on\r\n",
      "the matting, that she might leave her husband quite free. He entered\r\n",
      "the library and shut himself in, alone with his sorrow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She went up to her boudoir. The open bow-window let in the serene glory\r\n",
      "of the afternoon lying in the avenue, where the lime-trees cast long\r\n",
      "shadows. But Dorothea knew nothing of the scene. She threw herself on a\r\n",
      "chair, not heeding that she was in the dazzling sun-rays: if there were\r\n",
      "discomfort in that, how could she tell that it was not part of her\r\n",
      "inward misery?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was in the reaction of a rebellious anger stronger than any she had\r\n",
      "felt since her marriage. Instead of tears there came words:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What have I done—what am I—that he should treat me so? He never knows\r\n",
      "what is in my mind—he never cares. What is the use of anything I do? He\r\n",
      "wishes he had never married me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She began to hear herself, and was checked into stillness. Like one who\r\n",
      "has lost his way and is weary, she sat and saw as in one glance all the\r\n",
      "paths of her young hope which she should never find again. And just as\r\n",
      "clearly in the miserable light she saw her own and her husband’s\r\n",
      "solitude—how they walked apart so that she was obliged to survey him.\r\n",
      "If he had drawn her towards him, she would never have surveyed\r\n",
      "him—never have said, “Is he worth living for?” but would have felt him\r\n",
      "simply a part of her own life. Now she said bitterly, “It is his fault,\r\n",
      "not mine.” In the jar of her whole being, Pity was overthrown. Was it\r\n",
      "her fault that she had believed in him—had believed in his\r\n",
      "worthiness?—And what, exactly, was he?— She was able enough to estimate\r\n",
      "him—she who waited on his glances with trembling, and shut her best\r\n",
      "soul in prison, paying it only hidden visits, that she might be petty\r\n",
      "enough to please him. In such a crisis as this, some women begin to\r\n",
      "hate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sun was low when Dorothea was thinking that she would not go down\r\n",
      "again, but would send a message to her husband saying that she was not\r\n",
      "well and preferred remaining up-stairs. She had never deliberately\r\n",
      "allowed her resentment to govern her in this way before, but she\r\n",
      "believed now that she could not see him again without telling him the\r\n",
      "truth about her feeling, and she must wait till she could do it without\r\n",
      "interruption. He might wonder and be hurt at her message. It was good\r\n",
      "that he should wonder and be hurt. Her anger said, as anger is apt to\r\n",
      "say, that God was with her—that all heaven, though it were crowded with\r\n",
      "spirits watching them, must be on her side. She had determined to ring\r\n",
      "her bell, when there came a rap at the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon had sent to say that he would have his dinner in the\r\n",
      "library. He wished to be quite alone this evening, being much occupied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall not dine, then, Tantripp.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "Dorothea sat almost motionless in her meditative struggle, while the\r\n",
      "evening slowly deepened into night. But the struggle changed\r\n",
      "continually, as that of a man who begins with a movement towards\r\n",
      "striking and ends with conquering his desire to strike. The energy that\r\n",
      "would animate a crime is not more than is wanted to inspire a resolved\r\n",
      "submission, when the noble habit of the soul reasserts itself. That\r\n",
      "thought with which Dorothea had gone out to meet her husband—her\r\n",
      "conviction that he had been asking about the possible arrest of all his\r\n",
      "work, and that the answer must have wrung his heart, could not be long\r\n",
      "without rising beside the image of him, like a shadowy monitor looking\r\n",
      "at her anger with sad remonstrance. It cost her a litany of pictured\r\n",
      "sorrows and of silent cries that she might be the mercy for those\r\n",
      "sorrows—but the resolved submission did come; and when the house was\r\n",
      "still, and she knew that it was near the time when Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "habitually went to rest, she opened her door gently and stood outside\r\n",
      "in the darkness waiting for his coming up-stairs with a light in his\r\n",
      "hand. If he did not come soon she thought that she would go down and\r\n",
      "even risk incurring another pang. She would never again expect anything\r\n",
      "else. But she did hear the library door open, and slowly the light\r\n",
      "advanced up the staircase without noise from the footsteps on the\r\n",
      "carpet. When her husband stood opposite to her, she saw that his face\r\n",
      "was more haggard. He started slightly on seeing her, and she looked up\r\n",
      "at him beseechingly, without speaking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea!” he said, with a gentle surprise in his tone. “Were you\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I did not like to disturb you.”\r\n",

      "by watching.”\r\n",

      "her unjust or hard—overcame every scruple. That there had been some\r\n",
      "crisis in her husband’s mind she was certain: he had the very next day\r\n",
      "begun a new method of arranging his notes, and had associated her quite\r\n",
      "newly in carrying out his plan. Poor Dorothea needed to lay up stores\r\n",
      "of patience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was about four o’clock when she drove to Lydgate’s house in Lowick\r\n",
      "Gate, wishing, in her immediate doubt of finding him at home, that she\r\n",
      "had written beforehand. And he was not at home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?” said Dorothea, who had never, that she knew\r\n",
      "of, seen Rosamond, but now remembered the fact of the marriage. Yes,\r\n",
      "Mrs. Lydgate was at home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will go in and speak to her, if she will allow me. Will you ask her\r\n",
      "if she can see me—see Mrs. Casaubon, for a few minutes?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the servant had gone to deliver that message, Dorothea could hear\r\n",
      "sounds of music through an open window—a few notes from a man’s voice\r\n",
      "and then a piano bursting into roulades. But the roulades broke off\r\n",
      "suddenly, and then the servant came back saying that Mrs. Lydgate would\r\n",
      "be happy to see Mrs. Casaubon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the drawing-room door opened and Dorothea entered, there was a\r\n",
      "sort of contrast not infrequent in country life when the habits of the\r\n",
      "different ranks were less blent than now. Let those who know, tell us\r\n",
      "exactly what stuff it was that Dorothea wore in those days of mild\r\n",
      "autumn—that thin white woollen stuff soft to the touch and soft to the\r\n",
      "eye. It always seemed to have been lately washed, and to smell of the\r\n",
      "sweet hedges—was always in the shape of a pelisse with sleeves hanging\r\n",
      "all out of the fashion. Yet if she had entered before a still audience\r\n",
      "as Imogene or Cato’s daughter, the dress might have seemed right\r\n",
      "enough: the grace and dignity were in her limbs and neck; and about her\r\n",
      "simply parted hair and candid eyes the large round poke which was then\r\n",
      "in the fate of women, seemed no more odd as a head-dress than the gold\r\n",
      "trencher we call a halo. By the present audience of two persons, no\r\n",
      "dramatic heroine could have been expected with more interest than Mrs.\r\n",
      "Casaubon. To Rosamond she was one of those county divinities not mixing\r\n",
      "with Middlemarch mortality, whose slightest marks of manner or\r\n",
      "appearance were worthy of her study; moreover, Rosamond was not without\r\n",
      "satisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity of studying\r\n",
      "_her_. What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the\r\n",
      "best judges? and since Rosamond had received the highest compliments at\r\n",
      "Sir Godwin Lydgate’s, she felt quite confident of the impression she\r\n",
      "must make on people of good birth. Dorothea put out her hand with her\r\n",
      "usual simple kindness, and looked admiringly at Lydgate’s lovely\r\n",
      "bride—aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance, but\r\n",
      "seeing him merely as a coated figure at a wide angle. The gentleman was\r\n",
      "too much occupied with the presence of the one woman to reflect on the\r\n",
      "contrast between the two—a contrast that would certainly have been\r\n",
      "striking to a calm observer. They were both tall, and their eyes were\r\n",
      "on a level; but imagine Rosamond’s infantine blondness and wondrous\r\n",
      "crown of hair-plaits, with her pale-blue dress of a fit and fashion so\r\n",
      "perfect that no dressmaker could look at it without emotion, a large\r\n",
      "embroidered collar which it was to be hoped all beholders would know\r\n",
      "the price of, her small hands duly set off with rings, and that\r\n",
      "controlled self-consciousness of manner which is the expensive\r\n",
      "substitute for simplicity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you very much for allowing me to interrupt you,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "immediately. “I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if possible, before I go\r\n",
      "home, and I hoped that you might possibly tell me where I could find\r\n",
      "him, or even allow me to wait for him, if you expect him soon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is at the New Hospital,” said Rosamond; “I am not sure how soon he\r\n",
      "will come home. But I can send for him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you let me go and fetch him?” said Will Ladislaw, coming forward.\r\n",
      "He had already taken up his hat before Dorothea entered. She colored\r\n",
      "with surprise, but put out her hand with a smile of unmistakable\r\n",
      "pleasure, saying—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not know it was you: I had no thought of seeing you here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I go to the Hospital and tell Mr. Lydgate that you wish to see\r\n",
      "him?” said Will.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would be quicker to send the carriage for him,” said Dorothea, “if\r\n",
      "you will be kind enough to give the message to the coachman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was moving to the door when Dorothea, whose mind had flashed in an\r\n",
      "instant over many connected memories, turned quickly and said, “I will\r\n",
      "go myself, thank you. I wish to lose no time before getting home again.\r\n",
      "I will drive to the Hospital and see Mr. Lydgate there. Pray excuse me,\r\n",
      "Mrs. Lydgate. I am very much obliged to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought, and she left\r\n",
      "the room hardly conscious of what was immediately around her—hardly\r\n",
      "conscious that Will opened the door for her and offered her his arm to\r\n",
      "lead her to the carriage. She took the arm but said nothing. Will was\r\n",
      "feeling rather vexed and miserable, and found nothing to say on his\r\n",
      "side. He handed her into the carriage in silence, they said good-by,\r\n",
      "and Dorothea drove away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the five minutes’ drive to the Hospital she had time for some\r\n",
      "reflections that were quite new to her. Her decision to go, and her\r\n",
      "preoccupation in leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense that\r\n",
      "there would be a sort of deception in her voluntarily allowing any\r\n",
      "further intercourse between herself and Will which she was unable to\r\n",
      "mention to her husband, and already her errand in seeking Lydgate was a\r\n",
      "matter of concealment. That was all that had been explicitly in her\r\n",
      "mind; but she had been urged also by a vague discomfort. Now that she\r\n",
      "was alone in her drive, she heard the notes of the man’s voice and the\r\n",
      "accompanying piano, which she had not noted much at the time, returning\r\n",
      "on her inward sense; and she found herself thinking with some wonder\r\n",
      "that Will Ladislaw was passing his time with Mrs. Lydgate in her\r\n",
      "husband’s absence. And then she could not help remembering that he had\r\n",
      "passed some time with her under like circumstances, so why should there\r\n",
      "be any unfitness in the fact? But Will was Mr. Casaubon’s relative, and\r\n",
      "one towards whom she was bound to show kindness. Still there had been\r\n",
      "signs which perhaps she ought to have understood as implying that Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon did not like his cousin’s visits during his own absence.\r\n",
      "“Perhaps I have been mistaken in many things,” said poor Dorothea to\r\n",
      "herself, while the tears came rolling and she had to dry them quickly.\r\n",
      "She felt confusedly unhappy, and the image of Will which had been so\r\n",
      "clear to her before was mysteriously spoiled. But the carriage stopped\r\n",
      "at the gate of the Hospital. She was soon walking round the grass plots\r\n",
      "with Lydgate, and her feelings recovered the strong bent which had made\r\n",
      "her seek for this interview.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will Ladislaw, meanwhile, was mortified, and knew the reason of it\r\n",
      "clearly enough. His chances of meeting Dorothea were rare; and here for\r\n",
      "the first time there had come a chance which had set him at a\r\n",
      "disadvantage. It was not only, as it had been hitherto, that she was\r\n",
      "not supremely occupied with him, but that she had seen him under\r\n",
      "circumstances in which he might appear not to be supremely occupied\r\n",
      "with her. He felt thrust to a new distance from her, amongst the\r\n",
      "circles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her life. But that was\r\n",
      "not his fault: of course, since he had taken his lodgings in the town,\r\n",
      "he had been making as many acquaintances as he could, his position\r\n",
      "requiring that he should know everybody and everything. Lydgate was\r\n",
      "really better worth knowing than any one else in the neighborhood, and\r\n",
      "he happened to have a wife who was musical and altogether worth calling\r\n",
      "upon. Here was the whole history of the situation in which Diana had\r\n",
      "descended too unexpectedly on her worshipper. It was mortifying. Will\r\n",
      "was conscious that he should not have been at Middlemarch but for\r\n",
      "Dorothea; and yet his position there was threatening to divide him from\r\n",
      "her with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more fatal to\r\n",
      "the persistence of mutual interest than all the distance between Rome\r\n",
      "and Britain. Prejudices about rank and status were easy enough to defy\r\n",
      "in the form of a tyrannical letter from Mr. Casaubon; but prejudices,\r\n",
      "like odorous bodies, have a double existence both solid and\r\n",
      "subtle—solid as the pyramids, subtle as the twentieth echo of an echo,\r\n",
      "or as the memory of hyacinths which once scented the darkness. And Will\r\n",
      "was of a temperament to feel keenly the presence of subtleties: a man\r\n",
      "of clumsier perceptions would not have felt, as he did, that for the\r\n",
      "first time some sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with him had\r\n",
      "sprung up in Dorothea’s mind, and that their silence, as he conducted\r\n",
      "her to the carriage, had had a chill in it. Perhaps Casaubon, in his\r\n",
      "hatred and jealousy, had been insisting to Dorothea that Will had slid\r\n",
      "below her socially. Confound Casaubon!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will re-entered the drawing-room, took up his hat, and looking\r\n",
      "irritated as he advanced towards Mrs. Lydgate, who had seated herself\r\n",
      "at her work-table, said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is always fatal to have music or poetry interrupted. May I come\r\n",
      "another day and just finish about the rendering of ‘Lungi dal caro\r\n",
      "bene’?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall be happy to be taught,” said Rosamond. “But I am sure you\r\n",
      "admit that the interruption was a very beautiful one. I quite envy your\r\n",
      "acquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon. Is she very clever? She looks as if\r\n",
      "she were.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Really, I never thought about it,” said Will, sulkily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is just the answer Tertius gave me, when I first asked him if she\r\n",
      "were handsome. What is it that you gentlemen are thinking of when you\r\n",
      "are with Mrs. Casaubon?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Herself,” said Will, not indisposed to provoke the charming Mrs.\r\n",
      "Lydgate. “When one sees a perfect woman, one never thinks of her\r\n",
      "attributes—one is conscious of her presence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall be jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick,” said Rosamond,\r\n",
      "dimpling, and speaking with aery lightness. “He will come back and\r\n",
      "think nothing of me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That does not seem to have been the effect on Lydgate hitherto. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Casaubon is too unlike other women for them to be compared with her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a devout worshipper, I perceive. You often see her, I\r\n",
      "suppose.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Will, almost pettishly. “Worship is usually a matter of\r\n",
      "theory rather than of practice. But I am practising it to excess just\r\n",
      "at this moment—I must really tear myself away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray come again some evening: Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the music,\r\n",
      "and I cannot enjoy it so well without him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When her husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in front of\r\n",
      "him and holding his coat-collar with both her hands, “Mr. Ladislaw was\r\n",
      "here singing with me when Mrs. Casaubon came in. He seemed vexed. Do\r\n",
      "you think he disliked her seeing him at our house? Surely your position\r\n",
      "is more than equal to his—whatever may be his relation to the\r\n",
      "Casaubons.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no; it must be something else if he were really vexed. Ladislaw is\r\n",
      "a sort of gypsy; he thinks nothing of leather and prunella.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Music apart, he is not always very agreeable. Do you like him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes: I think he is a good fellow: rather miscellaneous and\r\n",
      "bric-a-brac, but likable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know, I think he adores Mrs. Casaubon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor devil!” said Lydgate, smiling and pinching his wife’s ears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond felt herself beginning to know a great deal of the world,\r\n",
      "especially in discovering what when she was in her unmarried girlhood\r\n",
      "had been inconceivable to her except as a dim tragedy in by-gone\r\n",
      "costumes—that women, even after marriage, might make conquests and\r\n",
      "enslave men. At that time young ladies in the country, even when\r\n",
      "educated at Mrs. Lemon’s, read little French literature later than\r\n",
      "Racine, and public prints had not cast their present magnificent\r\n",
      "illumination over the scandals of life. Still, vanity, with a woman’s\r\n",
      "whole mind and day to work in, can construct abundantly on slight\r\n",
      "hints, especially on such a hint as the possibility of indefinite\r\n",
      "conquests. How delightful to make captives from the throne of marriage\r\n",
      "with a husband as crown-prince by your side—himself in fact a\r\n",
      "subject—while the captives look up forever hopeless, losing their rest\r\n",
      "probably, and if their appetite too, so much the better! But Rosamond’s\r\n",
      "romance turned at present chiefly on her crown-prince, and it was\r\n",
      "enough to enjoy his assured subjection. When he said, “Poor devil!” she\r\n",
      "asked, with playful curiosity—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, what can a man do when he takes to adoring one of you mermaids?\r\n",
      "He only neglects his work and runs up bills.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure you do not neglect your work. You are always at the\r\n",
      "Hospital, or seeing poor patients, or thinking about some doctor’s\r\n",
      "quarrel; and then at home you always want to pore over your microscope\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Haven’t you ambition enough to wish that your husband should be\r\n",
      "something better than a Middlemarch doctor?” said Lydgate, letting his\r\n",
      "hands fall on to his wife’s shoulders, and looking at her with\r\n",
      "affectionate gravity. “I shall make you learn my favorite bit from an\r\n",
      "old poet—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "‘Why should our pride make such a stir to be\r\n",

      "“Of course, I wish you to make discoveries: no one could more wish you\r\n",
      "to attain a high position in some better place than Middlemarch. You\r\n",
      "cannot say that I have ever tried to hinder you from working. But we\r\n",
      "cannot live like hermits. You are not discontented with me, Tertius?”\r\n",

      "“No, dear, no. I am too entirely contented.”\r\n",

      "change in Mr. Casaubon’s bodily condition beyond the mental sign of\r\n",
      "anxiety to know the truth about his illness, she was silent for a few\r\n",
      "moments, wondering whether she had said or done anything to rouse this\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know whether your or Mr. Casaubon’s attention has been drawn\r\n",

      "rather egotistic in me to urge the subject; but that is not my fault:\r\n",
      "it is because there is a fight being made against it by the other\r\n",
      "medical men. I think you are generally interested in such things, for I\r\n",
      "remember that when I first had the pleasure of seeing you at Tipton\r\n",
      "Grange before your marriage, you were asking me some questions about\r\n",
      "the way in which the health of the poor was affected by their miserable\r\n",
      "housing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, brightening. “I shall be quite grateful\r\n",
      "to you if you will tell me how I can help to make things a little\r\n",
      "better. Everything of that sort has slipped away from me since I have\r\n",
      "been married. I mean,” she said, after a moment’s hesitation, “that the\r\n",
      "people in our village are tolerably comfortable, and my mind has been\r\n",
      "too much taken up for me to inquire further. But here—in such a place\r\n",
      "as Middlemarch—there must be a great deal to be done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is everything to be done,” said Lydgate, with abrupt energy.\r\n",
      "“And this Hospital is a capital piece of work, due entirely to Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s exertions, and in a great degree to his money. But one man\r\n",
      "can’t do everything in a scheme of this sort. Of course he looked\r\n",
      "forward to help. And now there’s a mean, petty feud set up against the\r\n",
      "thing in the town, by certain persons who want to make it a failure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What can be their reasons?” said Dorothea, with naive surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Chiefly Mr. Bulstrode’s unpopularity, to begin with. Half the town\r\n",
      "would almost take trouble for the sake of thwarting him. In this stupid\r\n",
      "world most people never consider that a thing is good to be done unless\r\n",
      "it is done by their own set. I had no connection with Bulstrode before\r\n",
      "I came here. I look at him quite impartially, and I see that he has\r\n",
      "some notions—that he has set things on foot—which I can turn to good\r\n",
      "public purpose. If a fair number of the better educated men went to\r\n",
      "work with the belief that their observations might contribute to the\r\n",
      "reform of medical doctrine and practice, we should soon see a change\r\n",
      "for the better. That’s my point of view. I hold that by refusing to\r\n",
      "work with Mr. Bulstrode I should be turning my back on an opportunity\r\n",
      "of making my profession more generally serviceable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "That opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to\r\n",
      "Dorothea was, like other oppositions, to be viewed in many different\r\n",
      "lights. He regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and dunderheaded\r\n",
      "prejudice. Mr. Bulstrode saw in it not only medical jealousy but a\r\n",
      "determination to thwart himself, prompted mainly by a hatred of that\r\n",
      "vital religion of which he had striven to be an effectual lay\r\n",
      "representative—a hatred which certainly found pretexts apart from\r\n",
      "religion such as were only too easy to find in the entanglements of\r\n",
      "human action. These might be called the ministerial views. But\r\n",
      "oppositions have the illimitable range of objections at command, which\r\n",
      "need never stop short at the boundary of knowledge, but can draw\r\n",
      "forever on the vasts of ignorance. What the opposition in Middlemarch\r\n",
      "said about the New Hospital and its administration had certainly a\r\n",
      "great deal of echo in it, for heaven has taken care that everybody\r\n",
      "shall not be an originator; but there were differences which\r\n",
      "represented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr.\r\n",
      "Minchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the\r\n",
      "Tankard in Slaughter Lane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her own asseveration,\r\n",
      "that Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the Hospital, if not to\r\n",
      "poison them, for the sake of cutting them up without saying by your\r\n",
      "leave or with your leave; for it was a known “fac” that he had wanted\r\n",
      "to cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street,\r\n",
      "who had money in trust before her marriage—a poor tale for a doctor,\r\n",
      "who if he was good for anything should know what was the matter with\r\n",
      "you before you died, and not want to pry into your inside after you\r\n",
      "were gone. If that was not reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what was;\r\n",
      "but there was a prevalent feeling in her audience that her opinion was\r\n",
      "a bulwark, and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits to\r\n",
      "the cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare with\r\n",
      "their pitch-plaisters—such a hanging business as that was not wanted in\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter\r\n",
      "Lane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old authentic\r\n",
      "public-house—the original Tankard, known by the name of Dollop’s—was\r\n",
      "the resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some months before put to\r\n",
      "the vote whether its long-standing medical man, “Doctor Gambit,” should\r\n",
      "not be cashiered in favor of “this Doctor Lydgate,” who was capable of\r\n",
      "performing the most astonishing cures, and rescuing people altogether\r\n",
      "given up by other practitioners. But the balance had been turned\r\n",
      "against Lydgate by two members, who for some private reasons held that\r\n",
      "this power of resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal\r\n",
      "recommendation, and might interfere with providential favors. In the\r\n",
      "course of the year, however, there had been a change in the public\r\n",

      "A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of\r\n",

      "depending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the\r\n",
      "stomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts, but not\r\n",
      "the less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence. Patients\r\n",
      "who had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn threadbare,\r\n",
      "like old Featherstone’s, had been at once inclined to try him; also,\r\n",
      "many who did not like paying their doctor’s bills, thought agreeably of\r\n",
      "opening an account with a new doctor and sending for him without stint\r\n",
      "if the children’s temper wanted a dose, occasions when the old\r\n",
      "practitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined to\r\n",
      "employ Lydgate held it likely that he was clever. Some considered that\r\n",
      "he might do more than others “where there was liver;”—at least there\r\n",
      "would be no harm in getting a few bottles of “stuff” from him, since if\r\n",
      "these proved useless it would still be possible to return to the\r\n",

      "yellowness. But these were people of minor importance. Good Middlemarch\r\n",

      "to accept a new man merely in the character of his successor, objecting\r\n",
      "that he was “not likely to be equal to Peacock.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars\r\n",
      "enough reported of him to breed much more specific expectations and to\r\n",
      "intensify differences into partisanship; some of the particulars being\r\n",
      "of that impressive order of which the significance is entirely hidden,\r\n",
      "like a statistical amount without a standard of comparison, but with a\r\n",
      "note of exclamation at the end. The cubic feet of oxygen yearly\r\n",
      "swallowed by a full-grown man—what a shudder they might have created in\r\n",
      "some Middlemarch circles! “Oxygen! nobody knows what that may be—is it\r\n",
      "any wonder the cholera has got to Dantzic? And yet there are people who\r\n",
      "say quarantine is no good!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not dispense\r\n",
      "drugs. This was offensive both to the physicians whose exclusive\r\n",
      "distinction seemed infringed on, and to the surgeon-apothecaries with\r\n",
      "whom he ranged himself; and only a little while before, they might have\r\n",
      "counted on having the law on their side against a man who without\r\n",
      "calling himself a London-made M.D. dared to ask for pay except as a\r\n",
      "charge on drugs. But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to foresee\r\n",
      "that his new course would be even more offensive to the laity; and to\r\n",
      "Mr. Mawmsey, an important grocer in the Top Market, who, though not one\r\n",
      "of his patients, questioned him in an affable manner on the subject, he\r\n",
      "was injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation of his\r\n",
      "reasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the character\r\n",
      "of practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public, if their only\r\n",
      "mode of getting paid for their work was by their making out long bills\r\n",
      "for draughts, boluses, and mixtures.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is in that way that hard-working medical men may come to be almost\r\n",
      "as mischievous as quacks,” said Lydgate, rather thoughtlessly. “To get\r\n",
      "their own bread they must overdose the king’s lieges; and that’s a bad\r\n",
      "sort of treason, Mr. Mawmsey—undermines the constitution in a fatal\r\n",
      "way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer (it was about a question of\r\n",
      "outdoor pay that he was having an interview with Lydgate), he was also\r\n",
      "asthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical point of\r\n",
      "view, as well as from his own, he was an important man; indeed, an\r\n",
      "exceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a flame-like pyramid,\r\n",
      "and whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging\r\n",
      "kind—jocosely complimentary, and with a certain considerate abstinence\r\n",
      "from letting out the full force of his mind. It was Mr. Mawmsey’s\r\n",
      "friendly jocoseness in questioning him which had set the tone of\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s reply. But let the wise be warned against too great readiness\r\n",
      "at explanation: it multiplies the sources of mistake, lengthening the\r\n",
      "sum for reckoners sure to go wrong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate smiled as he ended his speech, putting his foot into the\r\n",
      "stirrup, and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than he would have done if he had\r\n",
      "known who the king’s lieges were, giving his “Good morning, sir,\r\n",
      "good-morning, sir,” with the air of one who saw everything clearly\r\n",
      "enough. But in truth his views were perturbed. For years he had been\r\n",
      "paying bills with strictly made items, so that for every half-crown and\r\n",
      "eighteen-pence he was certain something measurable had been delivered.\r\n",
      "He had done this with satisfaction, including it among his\r\n",
      "responsibilities as a husband and father, and regarding a longer bill\r\n",
      "than usual as a dignity worth mentioning. Moreover, in addition to the\r\n",
      "massive benefit of the drugs to “self and family,” he had enjoyed the\r\n",
      "pleasure of forming an acute judgment as to their immediate effects, so\r\n",
      "as to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit—a\r\n",
      "practitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and\r\n",
      "especially esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had\r\n",
      "the poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, he was wont\r\n",
      "to say in an undertone, he placed Gambit above any of them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man, which\r\n",
      "appeared still flimsier in the drawing-room over the shop, when they\r\n",
      "were recited to Mrs. Mawmsey, a woman accustomed to be made much of as\r\n",
      "a fertile mother,—generally under attendance more or less frequent from\r\n",
      "Mr. Gambit, and occasionally having attacks which required Dr. Minchin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Does this Mr. Lydgate mean to say there is no use in taking medicine?”\r\n",
      "said Mrs. Mawmsey, who was slightly given to drawling. “I should like\r\n",
      "him to tell me how I could bear up at Fair time, if I didn’t take\r\n",
      "strengthening medicine for a month beforehand. Think of what I have to\r\n",
      "provide for calling customers, my dear!”—here Mrs. Mawmsey turned to an\r\n",
      "intimate female friend who sat by—“a large veal pie—a stuffed fillet—a\r\n",
      "round of beef—ham, tongue, et cetera, et cetera! But what keeps me up\r\n",
      "best is the pink mixture, not the brown. I wonder, Mr. Mawmsey, with\r\n",
      "_your_ experience, you could have patience to listen. I should have\r\n",
      "told him at once that I knew a little better than that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, no,” said Mr. Mawmsey; “I was not going to tell him my\r\n",
      "opinion. Hear everything and judge for yourself is my motto. But he\r\n",
      "didn’t know who he was talking to. I was not to be turned on _his_\r\n",
      "finger. People often pretend to tell me things, when they might as well\r\n",
      "say, ‘Mawmsey, you’re a fool.’ But I smile at it: I humor everybody’s\r\n",
      "weak place. If physic had done harm to self and family, I should have\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The next day Mr. Gambit was told that Lydgate went about saying physic\r\n",
      "was of no use.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed!” said he, lifting his eyebrows with cautious surprise. (He was\r\n",
      "a stout husky man with a large ring on his fourth finger.) “How will he\r\n",
      "cure his patients, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is what I say,” returned Mrs. Mawmsey, who habitually gave weight\r\n",
      "to her speech by loading her pronouns. “Does _he_ suppose that people\r\n",
      "will pay him only to come and sit with them and go away again?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Mawmsey had had a great deal of sitting from Mr. Gambit, including\r\n",
      "very full accounts of his own habits of body and other affairs; but of\r\n",
      "course he knew there was no innuendo in her remark, since his spare\r\n",
      "time and personal narrative had never been charged for. So he replied,\r\n",
      "humorously—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Lydgate is a good-looking young fellow, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not one that _I_ would employ,” said Mrs. Mawmsey. “_Others_ may do as\r\n",
      "they please.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hence Mr. Gambit could go away from the chief grocer’s without fear of\r\n",
      "rivalry, but not without a sense that Lydgate was one of those\r\n",
      "hypocrites who try to discredit others by advertising their own\r\n",
      "honesty, and that it might be worth some people’s while to show him up.\r\n",
      "Mr. Gambit, however, had a satisfactory practice, much pervaded by the\r\n",
      "smells of retail trading which suggested the reduction of cash payments\r\n",
      "to a balance. And he did not think it worth his while to show Lydgate\r\n",
      "up until he knew how. He had not indeed great resources of education,\r\n",
      "and had had to work his own way against a good deal of professional\r\n",
      "contempt; but he made none the worse accoucheur for calling the\r\n",
      "breathing apparatus “longs.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Other medical men felt themselves more capable. Mr. Toller shared the\r\n",
      "highest practice in the town and belonged to an old Middlemarch family:\r\n",
      "there were Tollers in the law and everything else above the line of\r\n",
      "retail trade. Unlike our irascible friend Wrench, he had the easiest\r\n",
      "way in the world of taking things which might be supposed to annoy him,\r\n",
      "being a well-bred, quietly facetious man, who kept a good house, was\r\n",
      "very fond of a little sporting when he could get it, very friendly with\r\n",
      "Mr. Hawley, and hostile to Mr. Bulstrode. It may seem odd that with\r\n",
      "such pleasant habits he should have been given to the heroic treatment,\r\n",
      "bleeding and blistering and starving his patients, with a dispassionate\r\n",
      "disregard to his personal example; but the incongruity favored the\r\n",
      "opinion of his ability among his patients, who commonly observed that\r\n",
      "Mr. Toller had lazy manners, but his treatment was as active as you\r\n",
      "could desire: no man, said they, carried more seriousness into his\r\n",
      "profession: he was a little slow in coming, but when he came, he _did_\r\n",
      "something. He was a great favorite in his own circle, and whatever he\r\n",
      "implied to any one’s disadvantage told doubly from his careless\r\n",
      "ironical tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He naturally got tired of smiling and saying, “Ah!” when he was told\r\n",
      "that Mr. Peacock’s successor did not mean to dispense medicines; and\r\n",
      "Mr. Hackbutt one day mentioning it over the wine at a dinner-party, Mr.\r\n",
      "Toller said, laughingly, “Dibbitts will get rid of his stale drugs,\r\n",

      "your opinion. I shall take an opportunity of expressing myself to that\r\n",
      "effect. A medical man should be responsible for the quality of the\r\n",
      "drugs consumed by his patients. That is the rationale of the system of\r\n",
      "charging which has hitherto obtained; and nothing is more offensive\r\n",
      "than this ostentation of reform, where there is no real amelioration.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ostentation, Hackbutt?” said Mr. Toller, ironically. “I don’t see\r\n",
      "that. A man can’t very well be ostentatious of what nobody believes in.\r\n",
      "There’s no reform in the matter: the question is, whether the profit on\r\n",
      "the drugs is paid to the medical man by the druggist or by the patient,\r\n",
      "and whether there shall be extra pay under the name of attendance.”\r\n",

      "Mr. Wrench, generally abstemious, often drank wine rather freely at a\r\n",

      "practitioner who dispenses drugs couldn’t be a gentleman. I throw back\r\n",
      "the imputation with scorn. I say, the most ungentlemanly trick a man\r\n",
      "can be guilty of is to come among the members of his profession with\r\n",
      "innovations which are a libel on their time-honored procedure. That is\r\n",
      "my opinion, and I am ready to maintain it against any one who\r\n",
      "contradicts me.” Mr. Wrench’s voice had become exceedingly sharp.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can’t oblige you there, Wrench,” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his\r\n",
      "hands into his trouser-pockets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear fellow,” said Mr. Toller, striking in pacifically, and looking\r\n",
      "at Mr. Wrench, “the physicians have their toes trodden on more than we\r\n",
      "have. If you come to dignity it is a question for Minchin and Sprague.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these\r\n",
      "infringements?” said Mr. Hackbutt, with a disinterested desire to offer\r\n",
      "his lights. “How does the law stand, eh, Hawley?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing to be done there,” said Mr. Hawley. “I looked into it for\r\n",
      "Sprague. You’d only break your nose against a damned judge’s decision.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pooh! no need of law,” said Mr. Toller. “So far as practice is\r\n",
      "concerned the attempt is an absurdity. No patient will like\r\n",
      "it—certainly not Peacock’s, who have been used to depletion. Pass the\r\n",
      "wine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Toller’s prediction was partly verified. If Mr. and Mrs. Mawmsey,\r\n",
      "who had no idea of employing Lydgate, were made uneasy by his supposed\r\n",
      "declaration against drugs, it was inevitable that those who called him\r\n",
      "in should watch a little anxiously to see whether he did “use all the\r\n",
      "means he might use” in the case. Even good Mr. Powderell, who in his\r\n",
      "constant charity of interpretation was inclined to esteem Lydgate the\r\n",
      "more for what seemed a conscientious pursuit of a better plan, had his\r\n",
      "mind disturbed with doubts during his wife’s attack of erysipelas, and\r\n",
      "could not abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a\r\n",
      "similar occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not\r\n",
      "otherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs.\r\n",
      "Powderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had begun in a\r\n",
      "remarkably hot August. At last, indeed, in the conflict between his\r\n",
      "desire not to hurt Lydgate and his anxiety that no “means” should be\r\n",
      "lacking, he induced his wife privately to take Widgeon’s Purifying\r\n",
      "Pills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine, which arrested every disease\r\n",
      "at the fountain by setting to work at once upon the blood. This\r\n",
      "co-operative measure was not to be mentioned to Lydgate, and Mr.\r\n",
      "Powderell himself had no certain reliance on it, only hoping that it\r\n",
      "might be attended with a blessing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in this doubtful stage of Lydgate’s introduction he was helped by\r\n",
      "what we mortals rashly call good fortune. I suppose no doctor ever came\r\n",
      "newly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody—cures\r\n",
      "which may be called fortune’s testimonials, and deserve as much credit\r\n",
      "as the written or printed kind. Various patients got well while Lydgate\r\n",
      "was attending them, some even of dangerous illnesses; and it was\r\n",
      "remarked that the new doctor with his new ways had at least the merit\r\n",
      "of bringing people back from the brink of death. The trash talked on\r\n",
      "such occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because it gave\r\n",
      "precisely the sort of prestige which an incompetent and unscrupulous\r\n",
      "man would desire, and was sure to be imputed to him by the simmering\r\n",
      "dislike of the other medical men as an encouragement on his own part of\r\n",
      "ignorant puffing. But even his proud outspokenness was checked by the\r\n",
      "discernment that it was as useless to fight against the interpretations\r\n",
      "of ignorance as to whip the fog; and “good fortune” insisted on using\r\n",
      "those interpretations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming\r\n",
      "symptoms in her charwoman, when Dr. Minchin called, asked him to see\r\n",
      "her then and there, and to give her a certificate for the Infirmary;\r\n",
      "whereupon after examination he wrote a statement of the case as one of\r\n",
      "tumor, and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as an out-patient. Nancy,\r\n",
      "calling at home on her way to the Infirmary, allowed the stay maker and\r\n",
      "his wife, in whose attic she lodged, to read Dr. Minchin’s paper, and\r\n",
      "by this means became a subject of compassionate conversation in the\r\n",
      "neighboring shops of Churchyard Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at\r\n",
      "first declared to be as large and hard as a duck’s egg, but later in\r\n",
      "the day to be about the size of “your fist.” Most hearers agreed that\r\n",
      "it would have to be cut out, but one had known of oil and another of\r\n",
      "“squitchineal” as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body\r\n",
      "when taken enough of into the inside—the oil by gradually “soopling,”\r\n",
      "the squitchineal by eating away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile when Nancy presented herself at the Infirmary, it happened to\r\n",
      "be one of Lydgate’s days there. After questioning and examining her,\r\n",
      "Lydgate said to the house-surgeon in an undertone, “It’s not tumor:\r\n",
      "it’s cramp.” He ordered her a blister and some steel mixture, and told\r\n",
      "her to go home and rest, giving her at the same time a note to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Larcher, who, she said, was her best employer, to testify that she was\r\n",
      "in need of good food.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But by-and-by Nancy, in her attic, became portentously worse, the\r\n",
      "supposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister, but only\r\n",
      "wandered to another region with angrier pain. The staymaker’s wife went\r\n",
      "to fetch Lydgate, and he continued for a fortnight to attend Nancy in\r\n",
      "her own home, until under his treatment she got quite well and went to\r\n",
      "work again. But the case continued to be described as one of tumor in\r\n",
      "Churchyard Lane and other streets—nay, by Mrs. Larcher also; for when\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s remarkable cure was mentioned to Dr. Minchin, he naturally\r\n",
      "did not like to say, “The case was not one of tumor, and I was mistaken\r\n",
      "in describing it as such,” but answered, “Indeed! ah! I saw it was a\r\n",
      "surgical case, not of a fatal kind.” He had been inwardly annoyed,\r\n",
      "however, when he had asked at the Infirmary about the woman he had\r\n",
      "recommended two days before, to hear from the house-surgeon, a\r\n",
      "youngster who was not sorry to vex Minchin with impunity, exactly what\r\n",
      "had occurred: he privately pronounced that it was indecent in a general\r\n",
      "practitioner to contradict a physician’s diagnosis in that open manner,\r\n",
      "and afterwards agreed with Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably\r\n",
      "inattentive to etiquette. Lydgate did not make the affair a ground for\r\n",
      "valuing himself or (very particularly) despising Minchin, such\r\n",
      "rectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal\r\n",
      "qualifications. But report took up this amazing case of tumor, not\r\n",
      "clearly distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful for\r\n",
      "being of the wandering sort; till much prejudice against Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "method as to drugs was overcome by the proof of his marvellous skill in\r\n",
      "the speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after she had been rolling and\r\n",
      "rolling in agonies from the presence of a tumor both hard and\r\n",
      "obstinate, but nevertheless compelled to yield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How could Lydgate help himself? It is offensive to tell a lady when she\r\n",
      "is expressing her amazement at your skill, that she is altogether\r\n",
      "mistaken and rather foolish in her amazement. And to have entered into\r\n",
      "the nature of diseases would only have added to his breaches of medical\r\n",
      "propriety. Thus he had to wince under a promise of success given by\r\n",
      "that ignorant praise which misses every valid quality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the case of a more conspicuous patient, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull,\r\n",
      "Lydgate was conscious of having shown himself something better than an\r\n",
      "every-day doctor, though here too it was an equivocal advantage that he\r\n",
      "won. The eloquent auctioneer was seized with pneumonia, and having been\r\n",
      "a patient of Mr. Peacock’s, sent for Lydgate, whom he had expressed his\r\n",
      "intention to patronize. Mr Trumbull was a robust man, a good subject\r\n",
      "for trying the expectant theory upon—watching the course of an\r\n",
      "interesting disease when left as much as possible to itself, so that\r\n",
      "the stages might be noted for future guidance; and from the air with\r\n",
      "which he described his sensations Lydgate surmised that he would like\r\n",
      "to be taken into his medical man’s confidence, and be represented as a\r\n",
      "partner in his own cure. The auctioneer heard, without much surprise,\r\n",
      "that his was a constitution which (always with due watching) might be\r\n",
      "left to itself, so as to offer a beautiful example of a disease with\r\n",
      "all its phases seen in clear delineation, and that he probably had the\r\n",
      "rare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test of a rational\r\n",
      "procedure, and thus make the disorder of his pulmonary functions a\r\n",
      "general benefit to society.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Trumbull acquiesced at once, and entered strongly into the view\r\n",
      "that an illness of his was no ordinary occasion for medical science.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never fear, sir; you are not speaking to one who is altogether\r\n",
      "ignorant of the _vis medicatrix_,” said he, with his usual superiority\r\n",
      "of expression, made rather pathetic by difficulty of breathing. And he\r\n",
      "went without shrinking through his abstinence from drugs, much\r\n",
      "sustained by application of the thermometer which implied the\r\n",
      "importance of his temperature, by the sense that he furnished objects\r\n",
      "for the microscope, and by learning many new words which seemed suited\r\n",
      "to the dignity of his secretions. For Lydgate was acute enough to\r\n",
      "indulge him with a little technical talk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be imagined that Mr. Trumbull rose from his couch with a\r\n",
      "disposition to speak of an illness in which he had manifested the\r\n",
      "strength of his mind as well as constitution; and he was not backward\r\n",
      "in awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned the quality of\r\n",
      "patient he had to deal with. The auctioneer was not an ungenerous man,\r\n",
      "and liked to give others their due, feeling that he could afford it. He\r\n",
      "had caught the words “expectant method,” and rang chimes on this and\r\n",
      "other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that Lydgate “knew a\r\n",
      "thing or two more than the rest of the doctors—was far better versed in\r\n",
      "the secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy’s illness had given\r\n",
      "to Mr. Wrench’s enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal ground.\r\n",
      "The new-comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of\r\n",
      "rivalry, and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical\r\n",
      "criticism or reflections on his hard-driven elders, who had had\r\n",
      "something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions. His\r\n",
      "practice had spread in one or two quarters, and from the first the\r\n",
      "report of his high family had led to his being pretty generally\r\n",
      "invited, so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the\r\n",
      "best houses; and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed\r\n",
      "always to end in a mutual attachment. There was hardly ever so much\r\n",
      "unanimity among them as in the opinion that Lydgate was an arrogant\r\n",
      "young fellow, and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to\r\n",
      "show a crawling subservience to Bulstrode. That Mr. Farebrother, whose\r\n",
      "name was a chief flag of the anti-Bulstrode party, always defended\r\n",
      "Lydgate and made a friend of him, was referred to Farebrother’s\r\n",
      "unaccountable way of fighting on both sides.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust\r\n",
      "at the announcement of the laws Mr. Bulstrode was laying down for the\r\n",
      "direction of the New Hospital, which were the more exasperating because\r\n",
      "there was no present possibility of interfering with his will and\r\n",
      "pleasure, everybody except Lord Medlicote having refused help towards\r\n",
      "the building, on the ground that they preferred giving to the Old\r\n",
      "Infirmary. Mr. Bulstrode met all the expenses, and had ceased to be\r\n",
      "sorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of\r\n",
      "improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors; but he had\r\n",
      "had to spend large sums, and the building had lingered. Caleb Garth had\r\n",
      "undertaken it, had failed during its progress, and before the interior\r\n",
      "fittings were begun had retired from the management of the business;\r\n",
      "and when referring to the Hospital he often said that however Bulstrode\r\n",
      "might ring if you tried him, he liked good solid carpentry and masonry,\r\n",
      "and had a notion both of drains and chimneys. In fact, the Hospital had\r\n",
      "become an object of intense interest to Bulstrode, and he would\r\n",
      "willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule\r\n",
      "it dictatorially without any Board; but he had another favorite object\r\n",
      "which also required money for its accomplishment: he wished to buy some\r\n",
      "land in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, and therefore he wished to get\r\n",
      "considerable contributions towards maintaining the Hospital. Meanwhile\r\n",
      "he framed his plan of management. The Hospital was to be reserved for\r\n",
      "fever in all its forms; Lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent,\r\n",
      "that he might have free authority to pursue all comparative\r\n",
      "investigations which his studies, particularly in Paris, had shown him\r\n",
      "the importance of, the other medical visitors having a consultative\r\n",
      "influence, but no power to contravene Lydgate’s ultimate decisions; and\r\n",
      "the general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of\r\n",
      "five directors associated with Mr. Bulstrode, who were to have votes in\r\n",
      "the ratio of their contributions, the Board itself filling up any\r\n",
      "vacancy in its numbers, and no mob of small contributors being admitted\r\n",
      "to a share of government.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the\r\n",
      "town to become a visitor at the Fever Hospital.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well,” said Lydgate to Mr. Bulstrode, “we have a capital\r\n",
      "house-surgeon and dispenser, a clear-headed, neat-handed fellow; we’ll\r\n",
      "get Webbe from Crabsley, as good a country practitioner as any of them,\r\n",
      "to come over twice a-week, and in case of any exceptional operation,\r\n",
      "Protheroe will come from Brassing. I must work the harder, that’s all,\r\n",
      "and I have given up my post at the Infirmary. The plan will flourish in\r\n",
      "spite of them, and then they’ll be glad to come in. Things can’t last\r\n",
      "as they are: there must be all sorts of reform soon, and then young\r\n",
      "fellows may be glad to come and study here.” Lydgate was in high\r\n",
      "spirits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall not flinch, you may depend upon it, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode. “While I see you carrying out high intentions with vigor,\r\n",
      "you shall have my unfailing support. And I have humble confidence that\r\n",
      "the blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit\r\n",
      "of evil in this town will not be withdrawn. Suitable directors to\r\n",
      "assist me I have no doubt of securing. Mr. Brooke of Tipton has already\r\n",
      "given me his concurrence, and a pledge to contribute yearly: he has not\r\n",
      "specified the sum—probably not a great one. But he will be a useful\r\n",
      "member of the board.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate\r\n",
      "nothing, and always vote with Mr. Bulstrode.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The medical aversion to Lydgate was hardly disguised now. Neither Dr.\r\n",
      "Sprague nor Dr. Minchin said that he disliked Lydgate’s knowledge, or\r\n",
      "his disposition to improve treatment: what they disliked was his\r\n",
      "arrogance, which nobody felt to be altogether deniable. They implied\r\n",
      "that he was insolent, pretentious, and given to that reckless\r\n",
      "innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the\r\n",
      "charlatan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop. In\r\n",
      "those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of Mr. St.\r\n",
      "John Long, “noblemen and gentlemen” attesting his extraction of a fluid\r\n",
      "like mercury from the temples of a patient.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Toller remarked one day, smilingly, to Mrs. Taft, that “Bulstrode\r\n",
      "had found a man to suit him in Lydgate; a charlatan in religion is sure\r\n",
      "to like other sorts of charlatans.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed, I can imagine,” said Mrs. Taft, keeping the number of\r\n",
      "thirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while; “there are so many\r\n",
      "of that sort. I remember Mr. Cheshire, with his irons, trying to make\r\n",
      "people straight when the Almighty had made them crooked.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no,” said Mr. Toller, “Cheshire was all right—all fair and above\r\n",
      "board. But there’s St. John Long—that’s the kind of fellow we call a\r\n",
      "charlatan, advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about: a\r\n",
      "fellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other\r\n",
      "people. The other day he was pretending to tap a man’s brain and get\r\n",
      "quicksilver out of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good gracious! what dreadful trifling with people’s constitutions!”\r\n",
      "said Mrs. Taft.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After this, it came to be held in various quarters that Lydgate played\r\n",
      "even with respectable constitutions for his own purposes, and how much\r\n",
      "more likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and\r\n",
      "sevens of hospital patients. Especially it was to be expected, as the\r\n",
      "landlady of the Tankard had said, that he would recklessly cut up their\r\n",
      "dead bodies. For Lydgate having attended Mrs. Goby, who died apparently\r\n",
      "of a heart-disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms, too\r\n",
      "daringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body, and thus gave\r\n",
      "an offence quickly spreading beyond Parley Street, where that lady had\r\n",
      "long resided on an income such as made this association of her body\r\n",
      "with the victims of Burke and Hare a flagrant insult to her memory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Affairs were in this stage when Lydgate opened the subject of the\r\n",
      "Hospital to Dorothea. We see that he was bearing enmity and silly\r\n",
      "misconception with much spirit, aware that they were partly created by\r\n",
      "his good share of success.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They will not drive me away,” he said, talking confidentially in Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother’s study. “I have got a good opportunity here, for the ends\r\n",
      "I care most about; and I am pretty sure to get income enough for our\r\n",
      "wants. By-and-by I shall go on as quietly as possible: I have no\r\n",
      "seductions now away from home and work. And I am more and more\r\n",
      "convinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous\r\n",
      "origin of all the tissues. Raspail and others are on the same track,\r\n",
      "and I have been losing time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have no power of prophecy there,” said Mr. Farebrother, who had been\r\n",
      "puffing at his pipe thoughtfully while Lydgate talked; “but as to the\r\n",
      "hostility in the town, you’ll weather it if you are prudent.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How am I to be prudent?” said Lydgate, “I just do what comes before me\r\n",
      "to do. I can’t help people’s ignorance and spite, any more than\r\n",
      "Vesalius could. It isn’t possible to square one’s conduct to silly\r\n",
      "conclusions which nobody can foresee.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite true; I didn’t mean that. I meant only two things. One is, keep\r\n",
      "yourself as separable from Bulstrode as you can: of course, you can go\r\n",
      "on doing good work of your own by his help; but don’t get tied. Perhaps\r\n",
      "it seems like personal feeling in me to say so—and there’s a good deal\r\n",
      "of that, I own—but personal feeling is not always in the wrong if you\r\n",
      "boil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bulstrode is nothing to me,” said Lydgate, carelessly, “except on\r\n",
      "public grounds. As to getting very closely united to him, I am not fond\r\n",
      "enough of him for that. But what was the other thing you meant?” said\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll tell you. His name was Vesalius. And the only way he could get to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“The cousins at Quallingham may go to the devil!” said Lydgate, with\r\n",

      "struggle for another kind of Reform.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the time that Lord John Russell’s measure was being debated in the\r\n",
      "House of Commons, there was a new political animation in Middlemarch,\r\n",
      "and a new definition of parties which might show a decided change of\r\n",
      "balance if a new election came. And there were some who already\r\n",
      "predicted this event, declaring that a Reform Bill would never be\r\n",
      "carried by the actual Parliament. This was what Will Ladislaw dwelt on\r\n",
      "to Mr. Brooke as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried\r\n",
      "his strength at the hustings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year,” said Will.\r\n",
      "“The public temper will soon get to a cometary heat, now the question\r\n",
      "of Reform has set in. There is likely to be another election before\r\n",
      "long, and by that time Middlemarch will have got more ideas into its\r\n",
      "head. What we have to work at now is the ‘Pioneer’ and political\r\n",
      "meetings.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite right, Ladislaw; we shall make a new thing of opinion here,”\r\n",
      "said Mr. Brooke. “Only I want to keep myself independent about Reform,\r\n",
      "you know; I don’t want to go too far. I want to take up Wilberforce’s\r\n",
      "and Romilly’s line, you know, and work at Negro Emancipation, Criminal\r\n",
      "Law—that kind of thing. But of course I should support Grey.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you go in for the principle of Reform, you must be prepared to take\r\n",
      "what the situation offers,” said Will. “If everybody pulled for his own\r\n",
      "bit against everybody else, the whole question would go to tatters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, I agree with you—I quite take that point of view. I should\r\n",
      "put it in that light. I should support Grey, you know. But I don’t want\r\n",
      "to change the balance of the constitution, and I don’t think Grey\r\n",
      "would.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But that is what the country wants,” said Will. “Else there would be\r\n",
      "no meaning in political unions or any other movement that knows what\r\n",
      "it’s about. It wants to have a House of Commons which is not weighted\r\n",
      "with nominees of the landed class, but with representatives of the\r\n",
      "other interests. And as to contending for a reform short of that, it is\r\n",
      "like asking for a bit of an avalanche which has already begun to\r\n",
      "thunder.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is fine, Ladislaw: that is the way to put it. Write that down,\r\n",

      "as well as the machine-breaking and general distress.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As to documents,” said Will, “a two-inch card will hold plenty. A few\r\n",
      "rows of figures are enough to deduce misery from, and a few more will\r\n",
      "show the rate at which the political determination of the people is\r\n",
      "growing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the misery, you know; and put the other figures and deduce—and so on.\r\n",

      "You’d never get elected, you know. And we shall always want talent in\r\n",
      "the House: reform as we will, we shall always want talent. That\r\n",
      "avalanche and the thunder, now, was really a little like Burke. I want\r\n",
      "that sort of thing—not ideas, you know, but a way of putting them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pocket-boroughs would be a fine thing,” said Ladislaw, “if they were\r\n",
      "always in the right pocket, and there were always a Burke at hand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison, even from\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke; for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be\r\n",
      "conscious of expressing one’s self better than others and never to have\r\n",
      "it noticed, and in the general dearth of admiration for the right\r\n",
      "thing, even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather\r\n",
      "fortifying. Will felt that his literary refinements were usually beyond\r\n",
      "the limits of Middlemarch perception; nevertheless, he was beginning\r\n",
      "thoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had said to\r\n",
      "himself rather languidly, “Why not?”—and he studied the political\r\n",
      "situation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to poetic\r\n",
      "metres or mediaevalism. It is undeniable that but for the desire to be\r\n",
      "where Dorothea was, and perhaps the want of knowing what else to do,\r\n",
      "Will would not at this time have been meditating on the needs of the\r\n",
      "English people or criticising English statesmanship: he would probably\r\n",
      "have been rambling in Italy sketching plans for several dramas, trying\r\n",
      "prose and finding it too jejune, trying verse and finding it too\r\n",
      "artificial, beginning to copy “bits” from old pictures, leaving off\r\n",
      "because they were “no good,” and observing that, after all,\r\n",
      "self-culture was the principal point; while in politics he would have\r\n",
      "been sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general. Our\r\n",
      "sense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place\r\n",
      "of dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not\r\n",
      "a matter of indifference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ladislaw had now accepted his bit of work, though it was not that\r\n",
      "indeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone\r\n",
      "worthy of continuous effort. His nature warmed easily in the presence\r\n",
      "of subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action, and the\r\n",
      "easily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit. In\r\n",
      "spite of Mr. Casaubon and the banishment from Lowick, he was rather\r\n",
      "happy; getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for\r\n",
      "practical purposes, and making the “Pioneer” celebrated as far as\r\n",
      "Brassing (never mind the smallness of the area; the writing was not\r\n",
      "worse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke was occasionally irritating; but Will’s impatience was\r\n",
      "relieved by the division of his time between visits to the Grange and\r\n",
      "retreats to his Middlemarch lodgings, which gave variety to his life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shift the pegs a little,” he said to himself, “and Mr. Brooke might be\r\n",
      "in the Cabinet, while I was Under-Secretary. That is the common order\r\n",
      "of things: the little waves make the large ones and are of the same\r\n",
      "pattern. I am better here than in the sort of life Mr. Casaubon would\r\n",
      "have trained me for, where the doing would be all laid down by a\r\n",
      "precedent too rigid for me to react upon. I don’t care for prestige or\r\n",
      "high pay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Lydgate had said of him, he was a sort of gypsy, rather enjoying the\r\n",
      "sense of belonging to no class; he had a feeling of romance in his\r\n",
      "position, and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise\r\n",
      "wherever he went. That sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he had\r\n",
      "felt some new distance between himself and Dorothea in their accidental\r\n",
      "meeting at Lydgate’s, and his irritation had gone out towards Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon, who had declared beforehand that Will would lose caste. “I\r\n",
      "never had any caste,” he would have said, if that prophecy had been\r\n",
      "uttered to him, and the quick blood would have come and gone like\r\n",
      "breath in his transparent skin. But it is one thing to like defiance,\r\n",
      "and another thing to like its consequences.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, the town opinion about the new editor of the “Pioneer” was\r\n",
      "tending to confirm Mr. Casaubon’s view. Will’s relationship in that\r\n",
      "distinguished quarter did not, like Lydgate’s high connections, serve\r\n",
      "as an advantageous introduction: if it was rumored that young Ladislaw\r\n",
      "was Mr. Casaubon’s nephew or cousin, it was also rumored that “Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon would have nothing to do with him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Brooke has taken him up,” said Mr. Hawley, “because that is what no\r\n",

      "reasons, you may be sure, for turning the cold shoulder on a young\r\n",
      "fellow whose bringing-up he paid for. Just like Brooke—one of those\r\n",
      "fellows who would praise a cat to sell a horse.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And some oddities of Will’s, more or less poetical, appeared to support\r\n",
      "Mr. Keck, the editor of the “Trumpet,” in asserting that Ladislaw, if\r\n",
      "the truth were known, was not only a Polish emissary but crack-brained,\r\n",
      "which accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his\r\n",
      "speech when he got on to a platform—as he did whenever he had an\r\n",
      "opportunity, speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid\r\n",
      "Englishmen generally. It was disgusting to Keck to see a strip of a\r\n",
      "fellow, with light curls round his head, get up and speechify by the\r\n",
      "hour against institutions “which had existed when he was in his\r\n",
      "cradle.” And in a leading article of the “Trumpet,” Keck characterized\r\n",
      "Ladislaw’s speech at a Reform meeting as “the violence of an\r\n",
      "energumen—a miserable effort to shroud in the brilliancy of fireworks\r\n",
      "the daring of irresponsible statements and the poverty of a knowledge\r\n",
      "which was of the cheapest and most recent description.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was a rattling article yesterday, Keck,” said Dr. Sprague, with\r\n",
      "sarcastic intentions. “But what is an energumen?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, a term that came up in the French Revolution,” said Keck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This dangerous aspect of Ladislaw was strangely contrasted with other\r\n",
      "habits which became matter of remark. He had a fondness, half artistic,\r\n",
      "half affectionate, for little children—the smaller they were on\r\n",
      "tolerably active legs, and the funnier their clothing, the better Will\r\n",
      "liked to surprise and please them. We know that in Rome he was given to\r\n",
      "ramble about among the poor people, and the taste did not quit him in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had somehow picked up a troop of droll children, little hatless boys\r\n",
      "with their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting to hang out,\r\n",
      "little girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes to look at him,\r\n",
      "and guardian brothers at the mature age of seven. This troop he had led\r\n",
      "out on gypsy excursions to Halsell Wood at nutting-time, and since the\r\n",
      "cold weather had set in he had taken them on a clear day to gather\r\n",
      "sticks for a bonfire in the hollow of a hillside, where he drew out a\r\n",
      "small feast of gingerbread for them, and improvised a Punch-and-Judy\r\n",
      "drama with some private home-made puppets. Here was one oddity. Another\r\n",
      "was, that in houses where he got friendly, he was given to stretch\r\n",
      "himself at full length on the rug while he talked, and was apt to be\r\n",
      "discovered in this attitude by occasional callers for whom such an\r\n",
      "irregularity was likely to confirm the notions of his dangerously mixed\r\n",
      "blood and general laxity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Will’s articles and speeches naturally recommended him in families\r\n",
      "which the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side\r\n",
      "of Reform. He was invited to Mr. Bulstrode’s; but here he could not lie\r\n",
      "down on the rug, and Mrs. Bulstrode felt that his mode of talking about\r\n",
      "Catholic countries, as if there were any truce with Antichrist,\r\n",
      "illustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Mr. Farebrother’s, however, whom the irony of events had brought on\r\n",
      "the same side with Bulstrode in the national movement, Will became a\r\n",
      "favorite with the ladies; especially with little Miss Noble, whom it\r\n",
      "was one of his oddities to escort when he met her in the street with\r\n",
      "her little basket, giving her his arm in the eyes of the town, and\r\n",
      "insisting on going with her to pay some call where she distributed her\r\n",
      "small filchings from her own share of sweet things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the house where he visited oftenest and lay most on the rug was\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s. The two men were not at all alike, but they agreed none the\r\n",
      "worse. Lydgate was abrupt but not irritable, taking little notice of\r\n",

      "much to her inward surprise; nevertheless he was gradually becoming\r\n",
      "necessary to her entertainment by his companionship in her music, his\r\n",
      "varied talk, and his freedom from the grave preoccupation which, with\r\n",
      "all her husband’s tenderness and indulgence, often made his manners\r\n",
      "unsatisfactory to her, and confirmed her dislike of the medical\r\n",

      "people in the efficacy of “the bill,” while nobody cared about the low\r\n",
      "state of pathology, sometimes assailed Will with troublesome questions.\r\n",
      "One evening in March, Rosamond in her cherry-colored dress with\r\n",
      "swansdown trimming about the throat sat at the tea-table; Lydgate,\r\n",
      "lately come in tired from his outdoor work, was seated sideways on an\r\n",
      "easy-chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow, his brow looking a\r\n",
      "little troubled as his eyes rambled over the columns of the “Pioneer,”\r\n",
      "while Rosamond, having noticed that he was perturbed, avoided looking\r\n",
      "at him, and inwardly thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody\r\n",
      "disposition. Will Ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the\r\n",
      "curtain-pole abstractedly, and humming very low the notes of “When\r\n",
      "first I saw thy face;” while the house spaniel, also stretched out with\r\n",
      "small choice of room, looked from between his paws at the usurper of\r\n",
      "the rug with silent but strong objection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond bringing Lydgate his cup of tea, he threw down the paper, and\r\n",
      "said to Will, who had started up and gone to the table—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s no use your puffing Brooke as a reforming landlord, Ladislaw:\r\n",
      "they only pick the more holes in his coat in the ‘Trumpet.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No matter; those who read the ‘Pioneer’ don’t read the ‘Trumpet,’”\r\n",
      "said Will, swallowing his tea and walking about. “Do you suppose the\r\n",
      "public reads with a view to its own conversion? We should have a\r\n",
      "witches’ brewing with a vengeance then—‘Mingle, mingle, mingle, mingle,\r\n",

      "“There’s no harm in trying. It’s good to have resident members.”\r\n",

      "“They represent the local stupidity better,” said Will, laughing, and\r\n",
      "shaking his curls; “and they are kept on their best behavior in the\r\n",
      "neighborhood. Brooke is not a bad fellow, but he has done some good\r\n",

      "a vote.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is the way with you political writers, Ladislaw—crying up a\r\n",

      "part of the very disease that wants curing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“That is no excuse for encouraging the superstitious exaggeration of\r\n",
      "hopes about this particular measure, helping the cry to swallow it\r\n",
      "whole and to send up voting popinjays who are good for nothing but to\r\n",
      "carry it. You go against rottenness, and there is nothing more\r\n",

      "enough at small questions of bribery, inquiring whether this or that\r\n",
      "voter has had a guinea when everybody knows that the seats have been\r\n",
      "sold wholesale. Wait for wisdom and conscience in public\r\n",
      "agents—fiddlestick! The only conscience we can trust to is the massive\r\n",
      "sense of wrong in a class, and the best wisdom that will work is the\r\n",
      "wisdom of balancing claims. That’s my text—which side is injured? I\r\n",

      "which he had often used himself, “if one did not work with such men as\r\n",
      "are at hand, things must come to a dead-lock. Suppose the worst opinion\r\n",

      "less true that he has the sense and the resolution to do what I think\r\n",
      "ought to be done in the matters I know and care most about; but that is\r\n",
      "the only ground on which I go with him,” Lydgate added rather proudly,\r\n",
      "bearing in mind Mr. Farebrother’s remarks. “He is nothing to me\r\n",

      "offended with Lydgate; not the less so, perhaps, because he would have\r\n",
      "declined any close inquiry into the growth of his relation to Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all,” said Lydgate, “I was simply explaining my own action. I\r\n",
      "meant that a man may work for a special end with others whose motives\r\n",
      "and general course are equivocal, if he is quite sure of his personal\r\n",
      "independence, and that he is not working for his private\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Then, why don’t you extend your liberality to others?” said Will,\r\n",
      "still nettled. “My personal independence is as important to me as yours\r\n",
      "is to you. You have no more reason to imagine that I have personal\r\n",
      "expectations from Brooke, than I have to imagine that you have personal\r\n",
      "expectations from Bulstrode. Motives are points of honor, I\r\n",
      "suppose—nobody can prove them. But as to money and place in the world,”\r\n",
      "Will ended, tossing back his head, “I think it is pretty clear that I\r\n",
      "am not determined by considerations of that sort.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You quite mistake me, Ladislaw,” said Lydgate, surprised. He had been\r\n",
      "preoccupied with his own vindication, and had been blind to what\r\n",
      "Ladislaw might infer on his own account. “I beg your pardon for\r\n",
      "unintentionally annoying you. In fact, I should rather attribute to you\r\n",
      "a romantic disregard of your own worldly interests. On the political\r\n",
      "question, I referred simply to intellectual bias.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How very unpleasant you both are this evening!” said Rosamond. “I\r\n",

      "two topics.”\r\n",

      "It happened to be on a Saturday evening that Will Ladislaw had that\r\n",
      "little discussion with Lydgate. Its effect when he went to his own\r\n",
      "rooms was to make him sit up half the night, thinking over again, under\r\n",
      "a new irritation, all that he had before thought of his having settled\r\n",
      "in Middlemarch and harnessed himself with Mr. Brooke. Hesitations\r\n",
      "before he had taken the step had since turned into susceptibility to\r\n",
      "every hint that he would have been wiser not to take it; and hence came\r\n",
      "his heat towards Lydgate—a heat which still kept him restless. Was he\r\n",
      "not making a fool of himself?—and at a time when he was more than ever\r\n",
      "conscious of being something better than a fool? And for what end?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, for no definite end. True, he had dreamy visions of\r\n",
      "possibilities: there is no human being who having both passions and\r\n",
      "thoughts does not think in consequence of his passions—does not find\r\n",
      "images rising in his mind which soothe the passion with hope or sting\r\n",
      "it with dread. But this, which happens to us all, happens to some with\r\n",
      "a wide difference; and Will was not one of those whose wit “keeps the\r\n",
      "roadway:” he had his bypaths where there were little joys of his own\r\n",
      "choosing, such as gentlemen cantering on the highroad might have\r\n",
      "thought rather idiotic. The way in which he made a sort of happiness\r\n",
      "for himself out of his feeling for Dorothea was an example of this. It\r\n",
      "may seem strange, but it is the fact, that the ordinary vulgar vision\r\n",
      "of which Mr. Casaubon suspected him—namely, that Dorothea might become\r\n",
      "a widow, and that the interest he had established in her mind might\r\n",
      "turn into acceptance of him as a husband—had no tempting, arresting\r\n",
      "power over him; he did not live in the scenery of such an event, and\r\n",
      "follow it out, as we all do with that imagined “otherwise” which is our\r\n",
      "practical heaven. It was not only that he was unwilling to entertain\r\n",
      "thoughts which could be accused of baseness, and was already uneasy in\r\n",
      "the sense that he had to justify himself from the charge of\r\n",
      "ingratitude—the latent consciousness of many other barriers between\r\n",
      "himself and Dorothea besides the existence of her husband, had helped\r\n",
      "to turn away his imagination from speculating on what might befall Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon. And there were yet other reasons. Will, we know, could not\r\n",
      "bear the thought of any flaw appearing in his crystal: he was at once\r\n",
      "exasperated and delighted by the calm freedom with which Dorothea\r\n",
      "looked at him and spoke to him, and there was something so exquisite in\r\n",
      "thinking of her just as she was, that he could not long for a change\r\n",
      "which must somehow change her. Do we not shun the street version of a\r\n",
      "fine melody?—or shrink from the news that the rarity—some bit of\r\n",
      "chiselling or engraving perhaps—which we have dwelt on even with\r\n",
      "exultation in the trouble it has cost us to snatch glimpses of it, is\r\n",
      "really not an uncommon thing, and may be obtained as an every-day\r\n",
      "possession? Our good depends on the quality and breadth of our emotion;\r\n",
      "and to Will, a creature who cared little for what are called the solid\r\n",
      "things of life and greatly for its subtler influences, to have within\r\n",
      "him such a feeling as he had towards Dorothea, was like the inheritance\r\n",
      "of a fortune. What others might have called the futility of his\r\n",
      "passion, made an additional delight for his imagination: he was\r\n",
      "conscious of a generous movement, and of verifying in his own\r\n",
      "experience that higher love-poetry which had charmed his fancy.\r\n",
      "Dorothea, he said to himself, was forever enthroned in his soul: no\r\n",
      "other woman could sit higher than her footstool; and if he could have\r\n",
      "written out in immortal syllables the effect she wrought within him, he\r\n",
      "might have boasted after the example of old Drayton, that,—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Queens hereafter might be glad to live\r\n",
      "Upon the alms of her superfluous praise.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this result was questionable. And what else could he do for\r\n",
      "Dorothea? What was his devotion worth to her? It was impossible to\r\n",
      "tell. He would not go out of her reach. He saw no creature among her\r\n",
      "friends to whom he could believe that she spoke with the same simple\r\n",
      "confidence as to him. She had once said that she would like him to\r\n",
      "stay; and stay he would, whatever fire-breathing dragons might hiss\r\n",
      "around her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This had always been the conclusion of Will’s hesitations. But he was\r\n",
      "not without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his own\r\n",
      "resolve. He had often got irritated, as he was on this particular\r\n",
      "night, by some outside demonstration that his public exertions with Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he would like them to be,\r\n",
      "and this was always associated with the other ground of irritation—that\r\n",
      "notwithstanding his sacrifice of dignity for Dorothea’s sake, he could\r\n",
      "hardly ever see her. Whereupon, not being able to contradict these\r\n",
      "unpleasant facts, he contradicted his own strongest bias and said, “I\r\n",
      "am a fool.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, since the inward debate necessarily turned on Dorothea,\r\n",
      "he ended, as he had done before, only by getting a livelier sense of\r\n",
      "what her presence would be to him; and suddenly reflecting that the\r\n",
      "morrow would be Sunday, he determined to go to Lowick Church and see\r\n",
      "her. He slept upon that idea, but when he was dressing in the rational\r\n",
      "morning light, Objection said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon’s prohibition to visit\r\n",
      "Lowick, and Dorothea will be displeased.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense!” argued Inclination, “it would be too monstrous for him to\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "Dorothea? Is he to have everything to himself and be always\r\n",
      "comfortable? Let him smart a little, as other people are obliged to do.\r\n",
      "I have always liked the quaintness of the church and congregation;\r\n",
      "besides, I know the Tuckers: I shall go into their pew.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having silenced Objection by force of unreason, Will walked to Lowick\r\n",
      "as if he had been on the way to Paradise, crossing Halsell Common and\r\n",
      "skirting the wood, where the sunlight fell broadly under the budding\r\n",
      "boughs, bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen, and fresh green\r\n",
      "growths piercing the brown. Everything seemed to know that it was\r\n",
      "Sunday, and to approve of his going to Lowick Church. Will easily felt\r\n",
      "happy when nothing crossed his humor, and by this time the thought of\r\n",
      "vexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to him, making his face\r\n",
      "break into its merry smile, pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine\r\n",
      "on the water—though the occasion was not exemplary. But most of us are\r\n",
      "apt to settle within ourselves that the man who blocks our way is\r\n",
      "odious, and not to mind causing him a little of the disgust which his\r\n",
      "personality excites in ourselves. Will went along with a small book\r\n",
      "under his arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but\r\n",
      "chanting a little, as he made scenes of what would happen in church and\r\n",
      "coming out. He was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his\r\n",
      "own, sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising. The\r\n",
      "words were not exactly a hymn, but they certainly fitted his Sunday\r\n",
      "experience:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“O me, O me, what frugal cheer\r\n",

      "left alone in it when the congregation had assembled. The curate’s pew\r\n",
      "was opposite the rector’s at the entrance of the small chancel, and\r\n",

      "the Powderells in their pews side by side; brother Samuel’s cheek had\r\n",
      "the same purple round as ever, and the three generations of decent\r\n",
      "cottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to their betters\r\n",
      "generally—the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the\r\n",
      "black gown and mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all\r\n",
      "betters, and the one most awful if offended. Even in 1831 Lowick was at\r\n",
      "peace, not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the\r\n",
      "Sunday sermon. The congregation had been used to seeing Will at church\r\n",
      "in former days, and no one took much note of him except the choir, who\r\n",
      "expected him to make a figure in the singing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea did at last appear on this quaint background, walking up the\r\n",
      "short aisle in her white beaver bonnet and gray cloak—the same she had\r\n",
      "worn in the Vatican. Her face being, from her entrance, towards the\r\n",
      "chancel, even her shortsighted eyes soon discerned Will, but there was\r\n",
      "no outward show of her feeling except a slight paleness and a grave bow\r\n",
      "as she passed him. To his own surprise Will felt suddenly\r\n",
      "uncomfortable, and dared not look at her after they had bowed to each\r\n",
      "other. Two minutes later, when Mr. Casaubon came out of the vestry,\r\n",
      "and, entering the pew, seated himself in face of Dorothea, Will felt\r\n",
      "his paralysis more complete. He could look nowhere except at the choir\r\n",
      "in the little gallery over the vestry-door: Dorothea was perhaps\r\n",
      "pained, and he had made a wretched blunder. It was no longer amusing to\r\n",
      "vex Mr. Casaubon, who had the advantage probably of watching him and\r\n",
      "seeing that he dared not turn his head. Why had he not imagined this\r\n",
      "beforehand?—but he could not expect that he should sit in that square\r\n",
      "pew alone, unrelieved by any Tuckers, who had apparently departed from\r\n",
      "Lowick altogether, for a new clergyman was in the desk. Still he called\r\n",
      "himself stupid now for not foreseeing that it would be impossible for\r\n",
      "him to look towards Dorothea—nay, that she might feel his coming an\r\n",
      "impertinence. There was no delivering himself from his cage, however;\r\n",
      "and Will found his places and looked at his book as if he had been a\r\n",
      "school-mistress, feeling that the morning service had never been so\r\n",
      "immeasurably long before, that he was utterly ridiculous, out of\r\n",
      "temper, and miserable. This was what a man got by worshipping the sight\r\n",
      "of a woman! The clerk observed with surprise that Mr. Ladislaw did not\r\n",
      "join in the tune of Hanover, and reflected that he might have a cold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon did not preach that morning, and there was no change in\r\n",
      "Will’s situation until the blessing had been pronounced and every one\r\n",
      "rose. It was the fashion at Lowick for “the betters” to go out first.\r\n",
      "With a sudden determination to break the spell that was upon him, Will\r\n",
      "looked straight at Mr. Casaubon. But that gentleman’s eyes were on the\r\n",
      "button of the pew-door, which he opened, allowing Dorothea to pass, and\r\n",
      "following her immediately without raising his eyelids. Will’s glance\r\n",
      "had caught Dorothea’s as she turned out of the pew, and again she\r\n",
      "bowed, but this time with a look of agitation, as if she were\r\n",
      "repressing tears. Will walked out after them, but they went on towards\r\n",
      "the little gate leading out of the churchyard into the shrubbery, never\r\n",
      "looking round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was impossible for him to follow them, and he could only walk back\r\n",
      "sadly at mid-day along the same road which he had trodden hopefully in\r\n",
      "the morning. The lights were all changed for him both without and\r\n",
      "within.\r\n",

      "Dorothea’s distress when she was leaving the church came chiefly from\r\n",
      "the perception that Mr. Casaubon was determined not to speak to his\r\n",
      "cousin, and that Will’s presence at church had served to mark more\r\n",
      "strongly the alienation between them. Will’s coming seemed to her quite\r\n",
      "excusable, nay, she thought it an amiable movement in him towards a\r\n",
      "reconciliation which she herself had been constantly wishing for. He\r\n",
      "had probably imagined, as she had, that if Mr. Casaubon and he could\r\n",
      "meet easily, they would shake hands and friendly intercourse might\r\n",
      "return. But now Dorothea felt quite robbed of that hope. Will was\r\n",
      "banished further than ever, for Mr. Casaubon must have been newly\r\n",
      "embittered by this thrusting upon him of a presence which he refused to\r\n",
      "recognize.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not been very well that morning, suffering from some difficulty\r\n",
      "in breathing, and had not preached in consequence; she was not\r\n",
      "surprised, therefore, that he was nearly silent at luncheon, still less\r\n",
      "that he made no allusion to Will Ladislaw. For her own part she felt\r\n",
      "that she could never again introduce that subject. They usually spent\r\n",
      "apart the hours between luncheon and dinner on a Sunday; Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "in the library dozing chiefly, and Dorothea in her boudoir, where she\r\n",
      "was wont to occupy herself with some of her favorite books. There was a\r\n",
      "little heap of them on the table in the bow-window—of various sorts,\r\n",
      "from Herodotus, which she was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to\r\n",
      "her old companion Pascal, and Keble’s “Christian Year.” But to-day she\r\n",
      "opened one after another, and could read none of them. Everything\r\n",
      "seemed dreary: the portents before the birth of Cyrus—Jewish\r\n",
      "antiquities—oh dear!—devout epigrams—the sacred chime of favorite\r\n",
      "hymns—all alike were as flat as tunes beaten on wood: even the spring\r\n",
      "flowers and the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon\r\n",
      "clouds that hid the sun fitfully; even the sustaining thoughts which\r\n",
      "had become habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future\r\n",
      "days in which she would still live with them for her sole companions.\r\n",
      "It was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor\r\n",
      "Dorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual\r\n",
      "effort demanded by her married life. She was always trying to be what\r\n",
      "her husband wished, and never able to repose on his delight in what she\r\n",
      "was. The thing that she liked, that she spontaneously cared to have,\r\n",
      "seemed to be always excluded from her life; for if it was only granted\r\n",
      "and not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied. About\r\n",
      "Will Ladislaw there had been a difference between them from the first,\r\n",
      "and it had ended, since Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s strong feeling about his claims on the family property, by\r\n",
      "her being convinced that she was in the right and her husband in the\r\n",
      "wrong, but that she was helpless. This afternoon the helplessness was\r\n",
      "more wretchedly benumbing than ever: she longed for objects who could\r\n",
      "be dear to her, and to whom she could be dear. She longed for work\r\n",
      "which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain, and\r\n",
      "now it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb,\r\n",
      "where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would\r\n",
      "never see the light. Today she had stood at the door of the tomb and\r\n",
      "seen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and\r\n",
      "fellowship—turning his face towards her as he went.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Books were of no use. Thinking was of no use. It was Sunday, and she\r\n",
      "could not have the carriage to go to Celia, who had lately had a baby.\r\n",
      "There was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and discontent, and\r\n",
      "Dorothea had to bear her bad mood, as she would have borne a headache.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After dinner, at the hour when she usually began to read aloud, Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon proposed that they should go into the library, where, he said,\r\n",
      "he had ordered a fire and lights. He seemed to have revived, and to be\r\n",
      "thinking intently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the library Dorothea observed that he had newly arranged a row of\r\n",
      "his note-books on a table, and now he took up and put into her hand a\r\n",
      "well-known volume, which was a table of contents to all the others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will oblige me, my dear,” he said, seating himself, “if instead of\r\n",
      "other reading this evening, you will go through this aloud, pencil in\r\n",
      "hand, and at each point where I say ‘mark,’ will make a cross with your\r\n",
      "pencil. This is the first step in a sifting process which I have long\r\n",
      "had in view, and as we go on I shall be able to indicate to you certain\r\n",
      "principles of selection whereby you will, I trust, have an intelligent\r\n",
      "participation in my purpose.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This proposal was only one more sign added to many since his memorable\r\n",
      "interview with Lydgate, that Mr. Casaubon’s original reluctance to let\r\n",
      "Dorothea work with him had given place to the contrary disposition,\r\n",
      "namely, to demand much interest and labor from her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After she had read and marked for two hours, he said, “We will take the\r\n",
      "volume up-stairs—and the pencil, if you please—and in case of reading\r\n",
      "in the night, we can pursue this task. It is not wearisome to you, I\r\n",
      "trust, Dorothea?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I prefer always reading what you like best to hear,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "who told the simple truth; for what she dreaded was to exert herself in\r\n",
      "reading or anything else which left him as joyless as ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a proof of the force with which certain characteristics in\r\n",
      "Dorothea impressed those around her, that her husband, with all his\r\n",
      "jealousy and suspicion, had gathered implicit trust in the integrity of\r\n",
      "her promises, and her power of devoting herself to her idea of the\r\n",
      "right and best. Of late he had begun to feel that these qualities were\r\n",
      "a peculiar possession for himself, and he wanted to engross them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The reading in the night did come. Dorothea in her young weariness had\r\n",
      "slept soon and fast: she was awakened by a sense of light, which seemed\r\n",
      "to her at first like a sudden vision of sunset after she had climbed a\r\n",
      "steep hill: she opened her eyes and saw her husband wrapped in his warm\r\n",
      "gown seating himself in the arm-chair near the fire-place where the\r\n",
      "embers were still glowing. He had lit two candles, expecting that\r\n",
      "Dorothea would awake, but not liking to rouse her by more direct means.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you ill, Edward?” she said, rising immediately.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I felt some uneasiness in a reclining posture. I will sit here for a\r\n",
      "time.” She threw wood on the fire, wrapped herself up, and said, “You\r\n",
      "would like me to read to you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You would oblige me greatly by doing so, Dorothea,” said Mr. Casaubon,\r\n",
      "with a shade more meekness than usual in his polite manner. “I am\r\n",
      "wakeful: my mind is remarkably lucid.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I fear that the excitement may be too great for you,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "remembering Lydgate’s cautions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I am not conscious of undue excitement. Thought is easy.” Dorothea\r\n",
      "dared not insist, and she read for an hour or more on the same plan as\r\n",
      "she had done in the evening, but getting over the pages with more\r\n",
      "quickness. Mr. Casaubon’s mind was more alert, and he seemed to\r\n",
      "anticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal indication,\r\n",
      "saying, “That will do—mark that”—or “Pass on to the next head—I omit\r\n",
      "the second excursus on Crete.” Dorothea was amazed to think of the\r\n",
      "bird-like speed with which his mind was surveying the ground where it\r\n",
      "had been creeping for years. At last he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Close the book now, my dear. We will resume our work to-morrow. I have\r\n",
      "deferred it too long, and would gladly see it completed. But you\r\n",
      "observe that the principle on which my selection is made, is to give\r\n",
      "adequate, and not disproportionate illustration to each of the theses\r\n",
      "enumerated in my introduction, as at present sketched. You have\r\n",
      "perceived that distinctly, Dorothea?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Dorothea, rather tremulously. She felt sick at heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And now I think that I can take some repose,” said Mr. Casaubon. He\r\n",
      "laid down again and begged her to put out the lights. When she had lain\r\n",
      "down too, and there was a darkness only broken by a dull glow on the\r\n",
      "hearth, he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Before I sleep, I have a request to make, Dorothea.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” said Dorothea, with dread in her mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is that you will let me know, deliberately, whether, in case of my\r\n",
      "death, you will carry out my wishes: whether you will avoid doing what\r\n",
      "I should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was not taken by surprise: many incidents had been leading her\r\n",
      "to the conjecture of some intention on her husband’s part which might\r\n",
      "make a new yoke for her. She did not answer immediately.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You refuse?” said Mr. Casaubon, with more edge in his tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I do not yet refuse,” said Dorothea, in a clear voice, the need of\r\n",
      "freedom asserting itself within her; “but it is too solemn—I think it\r\n",
      "is not right—to make a promise when I am ignorant what it will bind me\r\n",
      "to. Whatever affection prompted I would do without promising.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you would use your own judgment: I ask you to obey mine; you\r\n",
      "refuse.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, dear, no!” said Dorothea, beseechingly, crushed by opposing fears.\r\n",
      "“But may I wait and reflect a little while? I desire with my whole soul\r\n",
      "to do what will comfort you; but I cannot give any pledge\r\n",
      "suddenly—still less a pledge to do I know not what.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Grant me till to-morrow,” said Dorothea, beseechingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Till to-morrow then,” said Mr. Casaubon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon she could hear that he was sleeping, but there was no more sleep\r\n",
      "for her. While she constrained herself to lie still lest she should\r\n",
      "disturb him, her mind was carrying on a conflict in which imagination\r\n",
      "ranged its forces first on one side and then on the other. She had no\r\n",
      "presentiment that the power which her husband wished to establish over\r\n",
      "her future action had relation to anything else than his work. But it\r\n",
      "was clear enough to her that he would expect her to devote herself to\r\n",
      "sifting those mixed heaps of material, which were to be the doubtful\r\n",
      "illustration of principles still more doubtful. The poor child had\r\n",
      "become altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key\r\n",
      "which had made the ambition and the labor of her husband’s life. It was\r\n",
      "not wonderful that, in spite of her small instruction, her judgment in\r\n",
      "this matter was truer than his: for she looked with unbiassed\r\n",
      "comparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which he had risked\r\n",
      "all his egoism. And now she pictured to herself the days, and months,\r\n",
      "and years which she must spend in sorting what might be called\r\n",
      "shattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was itself a\r\n",
      "mosaic wrought from crushed ruins—sorting them as food for a theory\r\n",
      "which was already withered in the birth like an elfin child. Doubtless\r\n",
      "a vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the embryos of truth\r\n",
      "a-breathing: the quest of gold being at the same time a questioning of\r\n",
      "substances, the body of chemistry is prepared for its soul, and\r\n",
      "Lavoisier is born. But Mr. Casaubon’s theory of the elements which made\r\n",
      "the seed of all tradition was not likely to bruise itself unawares\r\n",
      "against discoveries: it floated among flexible conjectures no more\r\n",
      "solid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of likeness in\r\n",
      "sound until it was shown that likeness in sound made them impossible:\r\n",
      "it was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the necessity\r\n",
      "of forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate\r\n",
      "notion of Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for\r\n",
      "threading the stars together. And Dorothea had so often had to check\r\n",
      "her weariness and impatience over this questionable riddle-guessing, as\r\n",
      "it revealed itself to her instead of the fellowship in high knowledge\r\n",
      "which was to make life worthier! She could understand well enough now\r\n",
      "why her husband had come to cling to her, as possibly the only hope\r\n",
      "left that his labors would ever take a shape in which they could be\r\n",
      "given to the world. At first it had seemed that he wished to keep even\r\n",
      "her aloof from any close knowledge of what he was doing; but gradually\r\n",
      "the terrible stringency of human need—the prospect of a too speedy\r\n",
      "death—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And here Dorothea’s pity turned from her own future to her husband’s\r\n",
      "past—nay, to his present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out\r\n",
      "of that past: the lonely labor, the ambition breathing hardly under the\r\n",
      "pressure of self-distrust; the goal receding, and the heavier limbs;\r\n",
      "and now at last the sword visibly trembling above him! And had she not\r\n",
      "wished to marry him that she might help him in his life’s labor?—But\r\n",
      "she had thought the work was to be something greater, which she could\r\n",
      "serve in devoutly for its own sake. Was it right, even to soothe his\r\n",
      "grief—would it be possible, even if she promised—to work as in a\r\n",
      "treadmill fruitlessly?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And yet, could she deny him? Could she say, “I refuse to content this\r\n",
      "pining hunger?” It would be refusing to do for him dead, what she was\r\n",
      "almost sure to do for him living. If he lived as Lydgate had said he\r\n",
      "might, for fifteen years or more, her life would certainly be spent in\r\n",
      "helping him and obeying him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, there was a deep difference between that devotion to the living\r\n",
      "and that indefinite promise of devotion to the dead. While he lived, he\r\n",
      "could claim nothing that she would not still be free to remonstrate\r\n",
      "against, and even to refuse. But—the thought passed through her mind\r\n",
      "more than once, though she could not believe in it—might he not mean to\r\n",
      "demand something more from her than she had been able to imagine, since\r\n",
      "he wanted her pledge to carry out his wishes without telling her\r\n",
      "exactly what they were? No; his heart was bound up in his work only:\r\n",
      "that was the end for which his failing life was to be eked out by hers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, if she were to say, “No! if you die, I will put no finger to\r\n",
      "your work”—it seemed as if she would be crushing that bruised heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict, till she felt ill and\r\n",
      "bewildered, unable to resolve, praying mutely. Helpless as a child\r\n",
      "which has sobbed and sought too long, she fell into a late morning\r\n",
      "sleep, and when she waked Mr. Casaubon was already up. Tantripp told\r\n",
      "her that he had read prayers, breakfasted, and was in the library.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I never saw you look so pale, madam,” said Tantripp, a solid-figured\r\n",
      "woman who had been with the sisters at Lausanne.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was I ever high-colored, Tantripp?” said Dorothea, smiling faintly.\r\n",

      "nearer clumps of trees, hesitating, as she had done once before, though\r\n",
      "from a different cause. Then she had feared lest her effort at\r\n",
      "fellowship should be unwelcome; now she dreaded going to the spot where\r\n",
      "she foresaw that she must bind herself to a fellowship from which she\r\n",
      "shrank. Neither law nor the world’s opinion compelled her to this—only\r\n",
      "her husband’s nature and her own compassion, only the ideal and not the\r\n",
      "real yoke of marriage. She saw clearly enough the whole situation, yet\r\n",
      "she was fettered: she could not smite the stricken soul that entreated\r\n",
      "hers. If that were weakness, Dorothea was weak. But the half-hour was\r\n",
      "passing, and she must not delay longer. When she entered the Yew-tree\r\n",
      "Walk she could not see her husband; but the walk had bends, and she\r\n",
      "went, expecting to catch sight of his figure wrapped in a blue cloak,\r\n",
      "which, with a warm velvet cap, was his outer garment on chill days for\r\n",
      "the garden. It occurred to her that he might be resting in the\r\n",
      "summer-house, towards which the path diverged a little. Turning the\r\n",
      "angle, she could see him seated on the bench, close to a stone table.\r\n",
      "His arms were resting on the table, and his brow was bowed down on\r\n",
      "them, the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening his face on\r\n",
      "each side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "take that attitude when she was reading to him, as if he found it\r\n",
      "easier than any other; and that he would sometimes speak, as well as\r\n",
      "listen, with his face down in that way. She went into the summerhouse\r\n",
      "and said, “I am come, Edward; I am ready.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took no notice, and she thought that he must be fast asleep. She\r\n",
      "laid her hand on his shoulder, and repeated, “I am ready!” Still he was\r\n",
      "motionless; and with a sudden confused fear, she leaned down to him,\r\n",
      "took off his velvet cap, and leaned her cheek close to his head, crying\r\n",
      "in a distressed tone—\r\n",

      "through her mind the night before. She knew him, and called him by his\r\n",
      "name, but appeared to think it right that she should explain everything\r\n",

      "gossip. People say what they like to say, not what they have chapter\r\n",
      "and verse for,” said Mr Brooke, becoming acute about the truths that\r\n",
      "lay on the side of his own wishes. “I might get rid of Ladislaw up to a\r\n",
      "certain point—take away the ‘Pioneer’ from him, and that sort of thing;\r\n",

      "could come up to him as an agitator—an agitator, you know.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "has perhaps made some addition to his will—there may be some\r\n",
      "instructions for me,” said Dorothea, who had all the while had this\r\n",
      "conjecture in her mind with relation to her husband’s work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing about the rectory, my dear—nothing,” said Mr. Brooke, rising\r\n",
      "to go away, and putting out his hand to his nieces: “nor about his\r\n",
      "researches, you know. Nothing in the will.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s lip quivered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, you must not think of these things yet, my dear. By-and-by, you\r\n",
      "know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am quite well now, uncle; I wish to exert myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, well, we shall see. But I must run away now—I have no end of\r\n",
      "work now—it’s a crisis—a political crisis, you know. And here is Celia\r\n",
      "and her little man—you are an aunt, you know, now, and I am a sort of\r\n",
      "grandfather,” said Mr. Brooke, with placid hurry, anxious to get away\r\n",
      "and tell Chettam that it would not be his (Mr. Brooke’s) fault if\r\n",
      "Dorothea insisted on looking into everything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea sank back in her chair when her uncle had left the room, and\r\n",
      "cast her eyes down meditatively on her crossed hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look, Dodo! look at him! Did you ever see anything like that?” said\r\n",
      "Celia, in her comfortable staccato.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, Kitty?” said Dorothea, lifting her eyes rather absently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What? why, his upper lip; see how he is drawing it down, as if he\r\n",
      "meant to make a face. Isn’t it wonderful! He may have his little\r\n",
      "thoughts. I wish nurse were here. Do look at him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A large tear which had been for some time gathering, rolled down\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s cheek as she looked up and tried to smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you brooding over so? I am\r\n",
      "sure you did everything, and a great deal too much. You should be happy\r\n",
      "now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wonder if Sir James would drive me to Lowick. I want to look over\r\n",
      "everything—to see if there were any words written for me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go. And he has not\r\n",
      "said so yet (here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the\r\n",
      "gallery). Besides, you have got a wrong notion in your head as usual,\r\n",
      "Dodo—I can see that: it vexes me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where am I wrong, Kitty?” said Dorothea, quite meekly. She was almost\r\n",
      "ready now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really wondering\r\n",
      "with some fear what her wrong notion was. Celia felt her advantage, and\r\n",
      "was determined to use it. None of them knew Dodo as well as she did, or\r\n",
      "knew how to manage her. Since Celia’s baby was born, she had had a new\r\n",
      "sense of her mental solidity and calm wisdom. It seemed clear that\r\n",
      "where there was a baby, things were right enough, and that error, in\r\n",
      "general, was a mere lack of that central poising force.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo,” said\r\n",
      "Celia. “You are wanting to find out if there is anything uncomfortable\r\n",
      "for you to do now, only because Mr. Casaubon wished it. As if you had\r\n",
      "not been uncomfortable enough before. And he doesn’t deserve it, and\r\n",
      "you will find that out. He has behaved very badly. James is as angry\r\n",
      "with him as can be. And I had better tell you, to prepare you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Celia,” said Dorothea, entreatingly, “you distress me. Tell me at once\r\n",
      "what you mean.” It glanced through her mind that Mr. Casaubon had left\r\n",
      "the property away from her—which would not be so very distressing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, he has made a codicil to his will, to say the property was all to\r\n",
      "go away from you if you married—I mean—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is of no consequence,” said Dorothea, breaking in impetuously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But if you married Mr. Ladislaw, not anybody else,” Celia went on with\r\n",
      "persevering quietude. “Of course that is of no consequence in one\r\n",
      "way—you never _would_ marry Mr. Ladislaw; but that only makes it worse\r\n",
      "of Mr. Casaubon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The blood rushed to Dorothea’s face and neck painfully. But Celia was\r\n",
      "administering what she thought a sobering dose of fact. It was taking\r\n",
      "up notions that had done Dodo’s health so much harm. So she went on in\r\n",
      "her neutral tone, as if she had been remarking on baby’s robes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“James says so. He says it is abominable, and not like a gentleman. And\r\n",
      "there never was a better judge than James. It is as if Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "wanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr.\r\n",
      "Ladislaw—which is ridiculous. Only James says it was to hinder Mr.\r\n",
      "Ladislaw from wanting to marry you for your money—just as if he ever\r\n",
      "would think of making you an offer. Mrs. Cadwallader said you might as\r\n",
      "well marry an Italian with white mice! But I must just go and look at\r\n",
      "baby,” Celia added, without the least change of tone, throwing a light\r\n",
      "shawl over her, and tripping away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea by this time had turned cold again, and now threw herself back\r\n",
      "helplessly in her chair. She might have compared her experience at that\r\n",
      "moment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that her life was taking on\r\n",
      "a new form, that she was undergoing a metamorphosis in which memory\r\n",
      "would not adjust itself to the stirring of new organs. Everything was\r\n",
      "changing its aspect: her husband’s conduct, her own duteous feeling\r\n",
      "towards him, every struggle between them—and yet more, her whole\r\n",
      "relation to Will Ladislaw. Her world was in a state of convulsive\r\n",
      "change; the only thing she could say distinctly to herself was, that\r\n",
      "she must wait and think anew. One change terrified her as if it had\r\n",
      "been a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her departed\r\n",
      "husband, who had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting everything she\r\n",
      "said and did. Then again she was conscious of another change which also\r\n",
      "made her tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning of heart towards\r\n",
      "Will Ladislaw. It had never before entered her mind that he could,\r\n",
      "under any circumstances, be her lover: conceive the effect of the\r\n",
      "sudden revelation that another had thought of him in that light—that\r\n",
      "perhaps he himself had been conscious of such a possibility,—and this\r\n",
      "with the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting conditions, and\r\n",
      "questions not soon to be solved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It seemed a long while—she did not know how long—before she heard Celia\r\n",
      "saying, “That will do, nurse; he will be quiet on my lap now. You can\r\n",
      "go to lunch, and let Garratt stay in the next room. What I think,\r\n",
      "Dodo,” Celia went on, observing nothing more than that Dorothea was\r\n",
      "leaning back in her chair, and likely to be passive, “is that Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon was spiteful. I never did like him, and James never did. I\r\n",
      "think the corners of his mouth were dreadfully spiteful. And now he has\r\n",
      "behaved in this way, I am sure religion does not require you to make\r\n",
      "yourself uncomfortable about him. If he has been taken away, that is a\r\n",
      "mercy, and you ought to be grateful. We should not grieve, should we,\r\n",
      "baby?” said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise\r\n",
      "of the world, who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to\r\n",
      "the nails, and hair enough, really, when you took his cap off, to\r\n",
      "make—you didn’t know what:—in short, he was Bouddha in a Western form.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first things he\r\n",
      "said was, “I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs. Casaubon; have\r\n",
      "you been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse.” Dorothea’s hand was of\r\n",
      "a marble coldness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers,” said Celia. “She\r\n",
      "ought not, ought she?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate did not speak for a few moments. Then he said, looking at\r\n",
      "Dorothea. “I hardly know. In my opinion Mrs. Casaubon should do what\r\n",
      "would give her the most repose of mind. That repose will not always\r\n",
      "come from being forbidden to act.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Dorothea, exerting herself, “I am sure that is wise.\r\n",
      "There are so many things which I ought to attend to. Why should I sit\r\n",
      "here idle?” Then, with an effort to recall subjects not connected with\r\n",
      "her agitation, she added, abruptly, “You know every one in Middlemarch,\r\n",
      "I think, Mr. Lydgate. I shall ask you to tell me a great deal. I have\r\n",
      "serious things to do now. I have a living to give away. You know Mr.\r\n",
      "Tyke and all the—” But Dorothea’s effort was too much for her; she\r\n",
      "broke off and burst into sobs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate made her drink a dose of sal volatile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let Mrs. Casaubon do as she likes,” he said to Sir James, whom he\r\n",
      "asked to see before quitting the house. “She wants perfect freedom, I\r\n",
      "think, more than any other prescription.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His attendance on Dorothea while her brain was excited, had enabled him\r\n",
      "to form some true conclusions concerning the trials of her life. He\r\n",
      "felt sure that she had been suffering from the strain and conflict of\r\n",
      "self-repression; and that she was likely now to feel herself only in\r\n",
      "another sort of pinfold than that from which she had been released.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when he\r\n",
      "found that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about\r\n",
      "the will. There was no help for it now—no reason for any further delay\r\n",
      "in the execution of necessary business. And the next day Sir James\r\n",
      "complied at once with her request that he would drive her to Lowick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have no wish to stay there at present,” said Dorothea; “I could\r\n",
      "hardly bear it. I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia. I shall be\r\n",
      "able to think better about what should be done at Lowick by looking at\r\n",
      "it from a distance. And I should like to be at the Grange a little\r\n",
      "while with my uncle, and go about in all the old walks and among the\r\n",
      "people in the village.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not yet, I think. Your uncle is having political company, and you are\r\n",
      "better out of the way of such doings,” said Sir James, who at that\r\n",
      "moment thought of the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young Ladislaw’s.\r\n",
      "But no word passed between him and Dorothea about the objectionable\r\n",
      "part of the will; indeed, both of them felt that the mention of it\r\n",
      "between them would be impossible. Sir James was shy, even with men,\r\n",
      "about disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that Dorothea would have\r\n",
      "chosen to say, if she had spoken on the matter at all, was forbidden to\r\n",
      "her at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her\r\n",
      "husband’s injustice. Yet she did wish that Sir James could know what\r\n",
      "had passed between her and her husband about Will Ladislaw’s moral\r\n",
      "claim on the property: it would then, she thought, be apparent to him\r\n",
      "as it was to her, that her husband’s strange indelicate proviso had\r\n",
      "been chiefly urged by his bitter resistance to that idea of claim, and\r\n",
      "not merely by personal feelings more difficult to talk about. Also, it\r\n",
      "must be admitted, Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will’s\r\n",
      "sake, since her friends seemed to think of him as simply an object of\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon’s charity. Why should he be compared with an Italian\r\n",
      "carrying white mice? That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed like\r\n",
      "a mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish finger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer—searched all her husband’s\r\n",
      "places of deposit for private writing, but found no paper addressed\r\n",
      "especially to her, except that “Synoptical Tabulation,” which was\r\n",
      "probably only the beginning of many intended directions for her\r\n",
      "guidance. In carrying out this bequest of labor to Dorothea, as in all\r\n",
      "else, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating, oppressed in the plan\r\n",
      "of transmitting his work, as he had been in executing it, by the sense\r\n",
      "of moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea’s\r\n",
      "competence to arrange what he had prepared was subdued only by distrust\r\n",
      "of any other redactor. But he had come at last to create a trust for\r\n",
      "himself out of Dorothea’s nature: she could do what she resolved to do:\r\n",
      "and he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to\r\n",
      "erect a tomb with his name upon it. (Not that Mr. Casaubon called the\r\n",
      "future volumes a tomb; he called them the Key to all Mythologies.) But\r\n",
      "the months gained on him and left his plans belated: he had only had\r\n",
      "time to ask for that promise by which he sought to keep his cold grasp\r\n",
      "on Dorothea’s life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grasp had slipped away. Bound by a pledge given from the depths of\r\n",
      "her pity, she would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her\r\n",
      "judgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of\r\n",
      "faithfulness which is a supreme use. But now her judgment, instead of\r\n",
      "being controlled by duteous devotion, was made active by the\r\n",
      "imbittering discovery that in her past union there had lurked the\r\n",
      "hidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The living, suffering man\r\n",
      "was no longer before her to awaken her pity: there remained only the\r\n",
      "retrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been\r\n",
      "lower than she had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had\r\n",
      "even blinded his scrupulous care for his own character, and made him\r\n",
      "defeat his own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the\r\n",
      "property which was the sign of that broken tie, she would have been\r\n",
      "glad to be free from it and have nothing more than her original fortune\r\n",
      "which had been settled on her, if there had not been duties attached to\r\n",
      "ownership, which she ought not to flinch from. About this property many\r\n",
      "troublous questions insisted on rising: had she not been right in\r\n",
      "thinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?—but was it\r\n",
      "not impossible now for her to do that act of justice? Mr. Casaubon had\r\n",
      "taken a cruelly effective means of hindering her: even with indignation\r\n",
      "against him in her heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of\r\n",
      "his purpose revolted her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After collecting papers of business which she wished to examine, she\r\n",
      "locked up again the desks and drawers—all empty of personal words for\r\n",
      "her—empty of any sign that in her husband’s lonely brooding his heart\r\n",
      "had gone out to her in excuse or explanation; and she went back to\r\n",
      "Freshitt with the sense that around his last hard demand and his last\r\n",
      "injurious assertion of his power, the silence was unbroken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea tried now to turn her thoughts towards immediate duties, and\r\n",
      "one of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her\r\n",
      "of. Lydgate’s ear had caught eagerly her mention of the living, and as\r\n",
      "soon as he could, he reopened the subject, seeing here a possibility of\r\n",
      "making amends for the casting-vote he had once given with an\r\n",
      "ill-satisfied conscience. “Instead of telling you anything about Mr.\r\n",
      "Tyke,” he said, “I should like to speak of another man—Mr. Farebrother,\r\n",
      "the Vicar of St. Botolph’s. His living is a poor one, and gives him a\r\n",
      "stinted provision for himself and his family. His mother, aunt, and\r\n",
      "sister all live with him, and depend upon him. I believe he has never\r\n",
      "married because of them. I never heard such good preaching as his—such\r\n",
      "plain, easy eloquence. He would have done to preach at St. Paul’s Cross\r\n",
      "after old Latimer. His talk is just as good about all subjects:\r\n",
      "original, simple, clear. I think him a remarkable fellow: he ought to\r\n",
      "have done more than he has done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why has he not done more?” said Dorothea, interested now in all who\r\n",
      "had slipped below their own intention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s a hard question,” said Lydgate. “I find myself that it’s\r\n",
      "uncommonly difficult to make the right thing work: there are so many\r\n",
      "strings pulling at once. Farebrother often hints that he has got into\r\n",
      "the wrong profession; he wants a wider range than that of a poor\r\n",
      "clergyman, and I suppose he has no interest to help him on. He is very\r\n",
      "fond of Natural History and various scientific matters, and he is\r\n",
      "hampered in reconciling these tastes with his position. He has no money\r\n",
      "to spare—hardly enough to use; and that has led him into\r\n",
      "card-playing—Middlemarch is a great place for whist. He does play for\r\n",
      "money, and he wins a good deal. Of course that takes him into company a\r\n",
      "little beneath him, and makes him slack about some things; and yet,\r\n",
      "with all that, looking at him as a whole, I think he is one of the most\r\n",
      "blameless men I ever knew. He has neither venom nor doubleness in him,\r\n",
      "and those often go with a more correct outside.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wonder whether he suffers in his conscience because of that habit,”\r\n",
      "said Dorothea; “I wonder whether he wishes he could leave it off.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have no doubt he would leave it off, if he were transplanted into\r\n",
      "plenty: he would be glad of the time for other things.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man,” said\r\n",
      "Dorothea, meditatively. She was wishing it were possible to restore the\r\n",
      "times of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a\r\n",
      "strong desire to rescue him from his chance-gotten money.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,” said Lydgate.\r\n",
      "“His position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he is only a\r\n",
      "parson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better.\r\n",
      "Practically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an\r\n",
      "impatience of everything in which the parson doesn’t cut the principal\r\n",
      "figure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good\r\n",
      "deal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people\r\n",
      "uncomfortably aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!—he\r\n",
      "ought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the\r\n",
      "birds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“True,” said Dorothea. “It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our\r\n",
      "farmers and laborers get from their teaching. I have been looking into\r\n",
      "a volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at\r\n",
      "Lowick—I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the\r\n",
      "Apocalypse. I have always been thinking of the different ways in which\r\n",
      "Christianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a\r\n",
      "wider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest—I mean\r\n",
      "that which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most\r\n",
      "people as sharers in it. It is surely better to pardon too much, than\r\n",
      "to condemn too much. But I should like to see Mr. Farebrother and hear\r\n",
      "him preach.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do,” said Lydgate; “I trust to the effect of that. He is very much\r\n",
      "beloved, but he has his enemies too: there are always people who can’t\r\n",

      "the other side. He began, not without some inward rage, to think of\r\n",
      "going away from the neighborhood: it would be impossible for him to\r\n",

      "only the painful eagerness of unfed hope. There were plenty of reasons\r\n",

      "preferable.\r\n",

      "wavering statements, and also the liability of his mind to stick afresh\r\n",
      "at opposing arguments as they turned up in his memory, gave Will\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "something in that,’ and so on. I agree with you that this is a peculiar\r\n",
      "occasion—the country with a will of its own—political unions—that sort\r\n",
      "of thing—but we sometimes cut with rather too sharp a knife, Ladislaw.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke always ended by agreeing with Ladislaw, who still appeared\r\n",
      "to him a sort of Burke with a leaven of Shelley; but after an interval\r\n",
      "the wisdom of his own methods reasserted itself, and he was again drawn\r\n",
      "into using them with much hopefulness. At this stage of affairs he was\r\n",
      "in excellent spirits, which even supported him under large advances of\r\n",
      "money; for his powers of convincing and persuading had not yet been\r\n",
      "tested by anything more difficult than a chairman’s speech introducing\r\n",
      "other orators, or a dialogue with a Middlemarch voter, from which he\r\n",
      "came away with a sense that he was a tactician by nature, and that it\r\n",
      "was a pity he had not gone earlier into this kind of thing. He was a\r\n",

      "trader, and naturally one of the most doubtful voters in the\r\n",
      "borough—willing for his own part to supply an equal quality of teas and\r\n",
      "sugars to reformer and anti-reformer, as well as to agree impartially\r\n",
      "with both, and feeling like the burgesses of old that this necessity of\r\n",
      "electing members was a great burthen to a town; for even if there were\r\n",
      "no danger in holding out hopes to all parties beforehand, there would\r\n",
      "be the painful necessity at last of disappointing respectable people\r\n",
      "whose names were on his books. He was accustomed to receive large\r\n",
      "orders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton; but then, there were many of\r\n",
      "Pinkerton’s committee whose opinions had a great weight of grocery on\r\n",
      "their side. Mr. Mawmsey thinking that Mr. Brooke, as not too “clever in\r\n",
      "his intellects,” was the more likely to forgive a grocer who gave a\r\n",
      "hostile vote under pressure, had become confidential in his back\r\n",

      "Mawmsey, and enable her to bring up six children when I am no more? I\r\n",
      "put the question _fictiously_, knowing what must be the answer. Very\r\n",
      "well, sir. I ask you what, as a husband and a father, I am to do when\r\n",
      "gentlemen come to me and say, ‘Do as you like, Mawmsey; but if you vote\r\n",
      "against us, I shall get my groceries elsewhere: when I sugar my liquor\r\n",
      "I like to feel that I am benefiting the country by maintaining\r\n",
      "tradesmen of the right color.’ Those very words have been spoken to me,\r\n",
      "sir, in the very chair where you are now sitting. I don’t mean by your\r\n",
      "honorable self, Mr. Brooke.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, no—that’s narrow, you know. Until my butler complains to me of\r\n",
      "your goods, Mr. Mawmsey,” said Mr. Brooke, soothingly, “until I hear\r\n",
      "that you send bad sugars, spices—that sort of thing—I shall never order\r\n",
      "him to go elsewhere.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sir, I am your humble servant, and greatly obliged,” said Mr. Mawmsey,\r\n",
      "feeling that politics were clearing up a little. “There would be some\r\n",
      "pleasure in voting for a gentleman who speaks in that honorable\r\n",
      "manner.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you know, Mr. Mawmsey, you would find it the right thing to put\r\n",

      "thoroughly popular measure—a sort of A, B, C, you know, that must come\r\n",
      "first before the rest can follow. I quite agree with you that you’ve\r\n",
      "got to look at the thing in a family light: but public spirit, now.\r\n",
      "We’re all one family, you know—it’s all one cupboard. Such a thing as a\r\n",

      "no knowing what may be the effect of a vote,” Mr. Brooke ended, with a\r\n",
      "sense of being a little out at sea, though finding it still enjoyable.\r\n",
      "But Mr. Mawmsey answered in a tone of decisive check.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I beg your pardon, sir, but I can’t afford that. When I give a vote I\r\n",
      "must know what I am doing; I must look to what will be the effects on\r\n",
      "my till and ledger, speaking respectfully. Prices, I’ll admit, are what\r\n",
      "nobody can know the merits of; and the sudden falls after you’ve bought\r\n",
      "in currants, which are a goods that will not keep—I’ve never; myself\r\n",
      "seen into the ins and outs there; which is a rebuke to human pride. But\r\n",
      "as to one family, there’s debtor and creditor, I hope; they’re not\r\n",
      "going to reform that away; else I should vote for things staying as\r\n",
      "they are. Few men have less need to cry for change than I have,\r\n",
      "personally speaking—that is, for self and family. I am not one of those\r\n",
      "who have nothing to lose: I mean as to respectability both in parish\r\n",
      "and private business, and noways in respect of your honorable self and\r\n",
      "custom, which you was good enough to say you would not withdraw from\r\n",
      "me, vote or no vote, while the article sent in was satisfactory.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After this conversation Mr. Mawmsey went up and boasted to his wife\r\n",
      "that he had been rather too many for Brooke of Tipton, and that he\r\n",
      "didn’t mind so much now about going to the poll.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke on this occasion abstained from boasting of his tactics to\r\n",
      "Ladislaw, who for his part was glad enough to persuade himself that he\r\n",
      "had no concern with any canvassing except the purely argumentative\r\n",
      "sort, and that he worked no meaner engine than knowledge. Mr. Brooke,\r\n",
      "necessarily, had his agents, who understood the nature of the\r\n",
      "Middlemarch voter and the means of enlisting his ignorance on the side\r\n",
      "of the Bill—which were remarkably similar to the means of enlisting it\r\n",
      "on the side against the Bill. Will stopped his ears. Occasionally\r\n",
      "Parliament, like the rest of our lives, even to our eating and apparel,\r\n",
      "could hardly go on if our imaginations were too active about processes.\r\n",
      "There were plenty of dirty-handed men in the world to do dirty\r\n",
      "business; and Will protested to himself that his share in bringing Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke through would be quite innocent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But whether he should succeed in that mode of contributing to the\r\n",
      "majority on the right side was very doubtful to him. He had written out\r\n",
      "various speeches and memoranda for speeches, but he had begun to\r\n",
      "perceive that Mr. Brooke’s mind, if it had the burthen of remembering\r\n",
      "any train of thought, would let it drop, run away in search of it, and\r\n",
      "not easily come back again. To collect documents is one mode of serving\r\n",
      "your country, and to remember the contents of a document is another.\r\n",
      "No! the only way in which Mr. Brooke could be coerced into thinking of\r\n",
      "the right arguments at the right time was to be well plied with them\r\n",
      "till they took up all the room in his brain. But here there was the\r\n",
      "difficulty of finding room, so many things having been taken in\r\n",
      "beforehand. Mr. Brooke himself observed that his ideas stood rather in\r\n",
      "his way when he was speaking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, Ladislaw’s coaching was forthwith to be put to the test, for\r\n",
      "before the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain himself to the\r\n",
      "worthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of the White Hart,\r\n",
      "which looked out advantageously at an angle of the market-place,\r\n",
      "commanding a large area in front and two converging streets. It was a\r\n",
      "fine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful: there was some\r\n",
      "prospect of an understanding between Bagster’s committee and Brooke’s,\r\n",
      "to which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer, and such\r\n",
      "manufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy, gave a solidity which\r\n",
      "almost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his associates who sat for\r\n",
      "Pinkerton at the Green Dragon. Mr. Brooke, conscious of having weakened\r\n",
      "the blasts of the “Trumpet” against him, by his reforms as a landlord\r\n",
      "in the last half year, and hearing himself cheered a little as he drove\r\n",
      "into the town, felt his heart tolerably light under his buff-colored\r\n",
      "waistcoat. But with regard to critical occasions, it often happens that\r\n",
      "all moments seem comfortably remote until the last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This looks well, eh?” said Mr. Brooke as the crowd gathered. “I shall\r\n",
      "have a good audience, at any rate. I like this, now—this kind of public\r\n",
      "made up of one’s own neighbors, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The weavers and tanners of Middlemarch, unlike Mr. Mawmsey, had never\r\n",
      "thought of Mr. Brooke as a neighbor, and were not more attached to him\r\n",
      "than if he had been sent in a box from London. But they listened\r\n",
      "without much disturbance to the speakers who introduced the candidate,\r\n",
      "one of them—a political personage from Brassing, who came to tell\r\n",
      "Middlemarch its duty—spoke so fully, that it was alarming to think what\r\n",
      "the candidate could find to say after him. Meanwhile the crowd became\r\n",
      "denser, and as the political personage neared the end of his speech,\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke felt a remarkable change in his sensations while he still\r\n",
      "handled his eye-glass, trifled with documents before him, and exchanged\r\n",
      "remarks with his committee, as a man to whom the moment of summons was\r\n",
      "indifferent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll take another glass of sherry, Ladislaw,” he said, with an easy\r\n",
      "air, to Will, who was close behind him, and presently handed him the\r\n",
      "supposed fortifier. It was ill-chosen; for Mr. Brooke was an abstemious\r\n",
      "man, and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no great interval\r\n",
      "from the first was a surprise to his system which tended to scatter his\r\n",
      "energies instead of collecting them. Pray pity him: so many English\r\n",
      "gentlemen make themselves miserable by speechifying on entirely private\r\n",
      "grounds! whereas Mr. Brooke wished to serve his country by standing for\r\n",
      "Parliament—which, indeed, may also be done on private grounds, but\r\n",
      "being once undertaken does absolutely demand some speechifying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not about the beginning of his speech that Mr. Brooke was at all\r\n",
      "anxious; this, he felt sure, would be all right; he should have it\r\n",
      "quite pat, cut out as neatly as a set of couplets from Pope. Embarking\r\n",
      "would be easy, but the vision of open sea that might come after was\r\n",
      "alarming. “And questions, now,” hinted the demon just waking up in his\r\n",
      "stomach, “somebody may put questions about the schedules.—Ladislaw,” he\r\n",
      "continued, aloud, “just hand me the memorandum of the schedules.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Mr. Brooke presented himself on the balcony, the cheers were quite\r\n",
      "loud enough to counterbalance the yells, groans, brayings, and other\r\n",
      "expressions of adverse theory, which were so moderate that Mr. Standish\r\n",
      "(decidedly an old bird) observed in the ear next to him, “This looks\r\n",
      "dangerous, by God! Hawley has got some deeper plan than this.” Still,\r\n",
      "the cheers were exhilarating, and no candidate could look more amiable\r\n",
      "than Mr. Brooke, with the memorandum in his breast-pocket, his left\r\n",
      "hand on the rail of the balcony, and his right trifling with his\r\n",
      "eye-glass. The striking points in his appearance were his buff\r\n",
      "waistcoat, short-clipped blond hair, and neutral physiognomy. He began\r\n",
      "with some confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Gentlemen—Electors of Middlemarch!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was so much the right thing that a little pause after it seemed\r\n",
      "natural.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m uncommonly glad to be here—I was never so proud and happy in my\r\n",
      "life—never so happy, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a bold figure of speech, but not exactly the right thing; for,\r\n",
      "unhappily, the pat opening had slipped away—even couplets from Pope may\r\n",

      "may answer for once.” Mr. Brooke, meanwhile, having lost other clews,\r\n",

      "questions—machinery, now, and machine-breaking—you’re many of you\r\n",
      "concerned with machinery, and I’ve been going into that lately. It\r\n",

      "manufactures, commerce, interchange of staples—that kind of thing—since\r\n",

      "along, easily to himself, and would have come back from the remotest\r\n",
      "seas without trouble; but a diabolical procedure had been set up by the\r\n",
      "enemy. At one and the same moment there had risen above the shoulders\r\n",
      "of the crowd, nearly opposite Mr. Brooke, and within ten yards of him,\r\n",
      "the effigy of himself: buff-colored waistcoat, eye-glass, and neutral\r\n",
      "physiognomy, painted on rag; and there had arisen, apparently in the\r\n",
      "air, like the note of the cuckoo, a parrot-like, Punch-voiced echo of\r\n",
      "his words. Everybody looked up at the open windows in the houses at the\r\n",
      "opposite angles of the converging streets; but they were either blank,\r\n",
      "or filled by laughing listeners. The most innocent echo has an impish\r\n",
      "mockery in it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker, and this\r\n",
      "echo was not at all innocent; if it did not follow with the precision\r\n",
      "of a natural echo, it had a wicked choice of the words it overtook. By\r\n",
      "the time it said, “The Baltic, now,” the laugh which had been running\r\n",
      "through the audience became a general shout, and but for the sobering\r\n",
      "effects of party and that great public cause which the entanglement of\r\n",
      "things had identified with “Brooke of Tipton,” the laugh might have\r\n",
      "caught his committee. Mr. Bulstrode asked, reprehensively, what the new\r\n",
      "police was doing; but a voice could not well be collared, and an attack\r\n",
      "on the effigy of the candidate would have been too equivocal, since\r\n",
      "Hawley probably meant it to be pelted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke himself was not in a position to be quickly conscious of\r\n",
      "anything except a general slipping away of ideas within himself: he had\r\n",
      "even a little singing in the ears, and he was the only person who had\r\n",
      "not yet taken distinct account of the echo or discerned the image of\r\n",
      "himself. Few things hold the perceptions more thoroughly captive than\r\n",
      "anxiety about what we have got to say. Mr. Brooke heard the laughter;\r\n",
      "but he had expected some Tory efforts at disturbance, and he was at\r\n",
      "this moment additionally excited by the tickling, stinging sense that\r\n",
      "his lost exordium was coming back to fetch him from the Baltic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That reminds me,” he went on, thrusting a hand into his side-pocket,\r\n",
      "with an easy air, “if I wanted a precedent, you know—but we never want\r\n",
      "a precedent for the right thing—but there is Chatham, now; I can’t say\r\n",
      "I should have supported Chatham, or Pitt, the younger Pitt—he was not a\r\n",

      "Immediately the invisible Punch, who had hitherto followed Mr. Brooke,\r\n",
      "repeated, “Blast your ideas! we want the Bill.” The laugh was louder\r\n",
      "than ever, and for the first time Mr. Brooke being himself silent,\r\n",
      "heard distinctly the mocking echo. But it seemed to ridicule his\r\n",
      "interrupter, and in that light was encouraging; so he replied with\r\n",
      "amenity—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is something in what you say, my good friend, and what do we\r\n",

      "the paper from his breast-pocket, with a sense of being practical and\r\n",
      "coming to particulars. The invisible Punch followed:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You shall have the Bill, Mr. Brooke, per electioneering contest, and a\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Buffoonery, tricks, ridicule the test of truth—all that is very\r\n",
      "well”—here an unpleasant egg broke on Mr. Brooke’s shoulder, as the\r\n",
      "echo said, “All that is very well;” then came a hail of eggs, chiefly\r\n",
      "aimed at the image, but occasionally hitting the original, as if by\r\n",
      "chance. There was a stream of new men pushing among the crowd;\r\n",
      "whistles, yells, bellowings, and fifes made all the greater hubbub\r\n",
      "because there was shouting and struggling to put them down. No voice\r\n",
      "would have had wing enough to rise above the uproar, and Mr. Brooke,\r\n",
      "disagreeably anointed, stood his ground no longer. The frustration\r\n",
      "would have been less exasperating if it had been less gamesome and\r\n",
      "boyish: a serious assault of which the newspaper reporter “can aver\r\n",
      "that it endangered the learned gentleman’s ribs,” or can respectfully\r\n",
      "bear witness to “the soles of that gentleman’s boots having been\r\n",
      "visible above the railing,” has perhaps more consolations attached to\r\n",
      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "could, “This is a little too bad, you know. I should have got the ear\r\n",
      "of the people by-and-by—but they didn’t give me time. I should have\r\n",

      "“It was Bowyer who did it,” said Mr. Standish, evasively. “I know it as\r\n",

      "Will was thoroughly out of temper with himself as well as with his\r\n",
      "“principal,” and he went to shut himself in his rooms with a\r\n",

      "Why should he stay? If the impassable gulf between himself and Dorothea\r\n",
      "were ever to be filled up, it must rather be by his going away and\r\n",
      "getting into a thoroughly different position than by staying here and\r\n",
      "slipping into deserved contempt as an understrapper of Brooke’s. Then\r\n",
      "came the young dream of wonders that he might do—in five years, for\r\n",
      "example: political writing, political speaking, would get a higher\r\n",
      "value now public life was going to be wider and more national, and they\r\n",
      "might give him such distinction that he would not seem to be asking\r\n",
      "Dorothea to step down to him. Five years:—if he could only be sure that\r\n",
      "she cared for him more than for others; if he could only make her aware\r\n",
      "that he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering\r\n",
      "himself—then he could go away easily, and begin a career which at\r\n",
      "five-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things,\r\n",
      "where talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is delightful.\r\n",
      "He could speak and he could write; he could master any subject if he\r\n",
      "chose, and he meant always to take the side of reason and justice, on\r\n",
      "which he would carry all his ardor. Why should he not one day be lifted\r\n",
      "above the shoulders of the crowd, and feel that he had won that\r\n",
      "eminence well? Without doubt he would leave Middlemarch, go to town,\r\n",
      "and make himself fit for celebrity by “eating his dinners.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But not immediately: not until some kind of sign had passed between him\r\n",
      "and Dorothea. He could not be satisfied until she knew why, even if he\r\n",
      "were the man she would choose to marry, he would not marry her. Hence\r\n",
      "he must keep his post and bear with Mr. Brooke a little longer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he soon had reason to suspect that Mr. Brooke had anticipated him\r\n",
      "in the wish to break up their connection. Deputations without and\r\n",
      "voices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a\r\n",
      "stronger measure than usual for the good of mankind; namely, to\r\n",
      "withdraw in favor of another candidate, to whom he left the advantages\r\n",
      "of his canvassing machinery. He himself called this a strong measure,\r\n",

      "Ladislaw? dare say you are tired of it. However, we have dug a channel\r\n",

      "“No; though perhaps wisdom is not his strong point, but rather\r\n",
      "affection and sincerity. However, wisdom lies more in those two\r\n",

      "after he had gone to college. Mr. Garth told me what happened on the\r\n",
      "night of Featherstone’s death—how you refused to burn the will; and he\r\n",

      "pounds. I have kept that in mind, and I have heard something that may\r\n",

      "from you there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Farebrother paused a moment and looked at Mary. He meant to give\r\n",

      "mind of any superstitions, such as women sometimes follow when they do\r\n",
      "a man the wrong of marrying him as an act of atonement. Mary’s cheeks\r\n",
      "had begun to burn a little, and she was mute.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I mean, that your action made no real difference to Fred’s lot. I find\r\n",
      "that the first will would not have been legally good after the burning\r\n",
      "of the last; it would not have stood if it had been disputed, and you\r\n",
      "may be sure it would have been disputed. So, on that score, you may\r\n",
      "feel your mind free.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“Well, now I may go on. Fred, you know, has taken his degree. He has\r\n",
      "worked his way so far, and now the question is, what is he to do? That\r\n",
      "question is so difficult that he is inclined to follow his father’s\r\n",
      "wishes and enter the Church, though you know better than I do that he\r\n",
      "was quite set against that formerly. I have questioned him on the\r\n",
      "subject, and I confess I see no insuperable objection to his being a\r\n",
      "clergyman, as things go. He says that he could turn his mind to doing\r\n",
      "his best in that vocation, on one condition. If that condition were\r\n",
      "fulfilled I would do my utmost in helping Fred on. After a time—not, of\r\n",
      "course, at first—he might be with me as my curate, and he would have so\r\n",
      "much to do that his stipend would be nearly what I used to get as\r\n",
      "vicar. But I repeat that there is a condition without which all this\r\n",
      "good cannot come to pass. He has opened his heart to me, Miss Garth,\r\n",
      "and asked me to plead for him. The condition lies entirely in your\r\n",
      "feeling.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "little;” and when they were walking he added, “To speak quite plainly,\r\n",
      "Fred will not take any course which would lessen the chance that you\r\n",

      "never imagine him preaching and exhorting, and pronouncing blessings,\r\n",
      "and praying by the sick, without feeling as if I were looking at a\r\n",
      "caricature. His being a clergyman would be only for gentility’s sake,\r\n",
      "and I think there is nothing more contemptible than such imbecile\r\n",
      "gentility. I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with his empty face and\r\n",
      "neat umbrella, and mincing little speeches. What right have such men to\r\n",
      "represent Christianity—as if it were an institution for getting up\r\n",
      "idiots genteelly—as if—” Mary checked herself. She had been carried\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Young women are severe: they don’t feel the stress of action as men\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed, he has plenty of sense, but I think he would not show it\r\n",
      "as a clergyman. He would be a piece of professional affectation.”\r\n",

      "remaining single until he shall have earned your hand, or he may in any\r\n",
      "case be disappointed. Pardon me, Mary—you know I used to catechise you\r\n",
      "under that name—but when the state of a woman’s affections touches the\r\n",
      "happiness of another life—of more lives than one—I think it would be\r\n",

      "strange idea flashed across her that his words had reference to\r\n",
      "himself, she was incredulous, and ashamed of entertaining it. She had\r\n",
      "never thought that any man could love her except Fred, who had espoused\r\n",

      "when we were very little. I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to\r\n",

      "marry a genteel young person; but these were all accidents and joys\r\n",
      "that imagination could dispense with. The one joy after which his soul\r\n",
      "thirsted was to have a money-changer’s shop on a much-frequented quay,\r\n",
      "to have locks all round him of which he held the keys, and to look\r\n",
      "sublimely cool as he handled the breeding coins of all nations, while\r\n",
      "helpless Cupidity looked at him enviously from the other side of an\r\n",
      "iron lattice. The strength of that passion had been a power enabling\r\n",
      "him to master all the knowledge necessary to gratify it. And when\r\n",
      "others were thinking that he had settled at Stone Court for life,\r\n",
      "Joshua himself was thinking that the moment now was not far off when he\r\n",
      "should settle on the North Quay with the best appointments in safes and\r\n",
      "locks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Enough. We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg’s sale of his land\r\n",
      "from Mr. Bulstrode’s point of view, and he interpreted it as a cheering\r\n",
      "dispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which he had for\r\n",
      "some time entertained without external encouragement; he interpreted it\r\n",
      "thus, but not too confidently, offering up his thanksgiving in guarded\r\n",
      "phraseology. His doubts did not arise from the possible relations of\r\n",
      "the event to Joshua Rigg’s destiny, which belonged to the unmapped\r\n",
      "regions not taken under the providential government, except perhaps in\r\n",
      "an imperfect colonial way; but they arose from reflecting that this\r\n",
      "dispensation too might be a chastisement for himself, as Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother’s induction to the living clearly was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of\r\n",
      "deceiving him: it was what he said to himself—it was as genuinely his\r\n",
      "mode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you happen\r\n",
      "to disagree with him. For the egoism which enters into our theories\r\n",
      "does not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is\r\n",
      "satisfied, the more robust is our belief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr. Bulstrode,\r\n",
      "hardly fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone, had become\r\n",
      "the proprietor of Stone Court, and what Peter would say “if he were\r\n",
      "worthy to know,” had become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of\r\n",
      "conversation to his disappointed relatives. The tables were now turned\r\n",
      "on that dear brother departed, and to contemplate the frustration of\r\n",
      "his cunning by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of\r\n",
      "delight to Solomon. Mrs. Waule had a melancholy triumph in the proof\r\n",
      "that it did not answer to make false Featherstones and cut off the\r\n",
      "genuine; and Sister Martha receiving the news in the Chalky Flats said,\r\n",
      "“Dear, dear! then the Almighty could have been none so pleased with the\r\n",
      "almshouses after all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Affectionate Mrs. Bulstrode was particularly glad of the advantage\r\n",
      "which her husband’s health was likely to get from the purchase of Stone\r\n",
      "Court. Few days passed without his riding thither and looking over some\r\n",
      "part of the farm with the bailiff, and the evenings were delicious in\r\n",
      "that quiet spot, when the new hay-ricks lately set up were sending\r\n",
      "forth odors to mingle with the breath of the rich old garden. One\r\n",
      "evening, while the sun was still above the horizon and burning in\r\n",
      "golden lamps among the great walnut boughs, Mr. Bulstrode was pausing\r\n",
      "on horseback outside the front gate waiting for Caleb Garth, who had\r\n",
      "met him by appointment to give an opinion on a question of stable\r\n",
      "drainage, and was now advising the bailiff in the rick-yard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame and more\r\n",
      "than usually serene, under the influence of his innocent recreation. He\r\n",
      "was doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in\r\n",
      "himself; but that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when\r\n",
      "the sense of demerit does not take a distinct shape in memory and\r\n",
      "revive the tingling of shame or the pang of remorse. Nay, it may be\r\n",
      "held with intense satisfaction when the depth of our sinning is but a\r\n",
      "measure for the depth of forgiveness, and a clenching proof that we are\r\n",
      "peculiar instruments of the divine intention. The memory has as many\r\n",
      "moods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama. At this\r\n",
      "moment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of\r\n",
      "far-off evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out\r\n",
      "preaching beyond Highbury. And he would willingly have had that service\r\n",
      "of exhortation in prospect now. The texts were there still, and so was\r\n",
      "his own facility in expounding them. His brief reverie was interrupted\r\n",
      "by the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on horseback, and was just\r\n",
      "shaking his bridle before starting, when he exclaimed—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bless my heart! what’s this fellow in black coming along the lane?\r\n",
      "He’s like one of those men one sees about after the races.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode turned his horse and looked along the lane, but made no\r\n",
      "reply. The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles, whose\r\n",
      "appearance presented no other change than such as was due to a suit of\r\n",
      "black and a crape hat-band. He was within three yards of the horseman\r\n",
      "now, and they could see the flash of recognition in his face as he\r\n",
      "whirled his stick upward, looking all the while at Mr. Bulstrode, and\r\n",
      "at last exclaiming:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By Jove, Nick, it’s you! I couldn’t be mistaken, though the\r\n",
      "five-and-twenty years have played old Boguy with us both! How are you,\r\n",
      "eh? you didn’t expect to see _me_ here. Come, shake us by the hand.” To\r\n",
      "say that Mr. Raffles’ manner was rather excited would be only one mode\r\n",
      "of saying that it was evening. Caleb Garth could see that there was a\r\n",
      "moment of struggle and hesitation in Mr. Bulstrode, but it ended in his\r\n",
      "putting out his hand coldly to Raffles and saying—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not indeed expect to see you in this remote country place.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it belongs to a stepson of mine,” said Raffles, adjusting\r\n",
      "himself in a swaggering attitude. “I came to see him here before. I’m\r\n",
      "not so surprised at seeing you, old fellow, because I picked up a\r\n",
      "letter—what you may call a providential thing. It’s uncommonly\r\n",
      "fortunate I met you, though; for I don’t care about seeing my stepson:\r\n",
      "he’s not affectionate, and his poor mother’s gone now. To tell the\r\n",
      "truth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your address,\r\n",
      "for—look here!” Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his pocket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to linger\r\n",
      "on the spot for the sake of hearing all he could about a man whose\r\n",
      "acquaintance with Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the banker’s\r\n",
      "life so unlike anything that was known of him in Middlemarch that they\r\n",
      "must have the nature of a secret to pique curiosity. But Caleb was\r\n",
      "peculiar: certain human tendencies which are commonly strong were\r\n",
      "almost absent from his mind; and one of these was curiosity about\r\n",
      "personal affairs. Especially if there was anything discreditable to be\r\n",
      "found out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to know it; and\r\n",
      "if he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were\r\n",
      "discovered, he was more embarrassed than the culprit. He now spurred\r\n",
      "his horse, and saying, “I wish you good evening, Mr. Bulstrode; I must\r\n",
      "be getting home,” set off at a trot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You didn’t put your full address to this letter,” Raffles continued.\r\n",
      "“That was not like the first-rate man of business you used to be. ‘The\r\n",
      "Shrubs,’—they may be anywhere: you live near at hand, eh?—have cut the\r\n",
      "London concern altogether—perhaps turned country squire—have a rural\r\n",
      "mansion to invite me to. Lord, how many years it is ago! The old lady\r\n",
      "must have been dead a pretty long while—gone to glory without the pain\r\n",
      "of knowing how poor her daughter was, eh? But, by Jove! you’re very\r\n",
      "pale and pasty, Nick. Come, if you’re going home, I’ll walk by your\r\n",
      "side.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode’s usual paleness had in fact taken an almost deathly hue.\r\n",
      "Five minutes before, the expanse of his life had been submerged in its\r\n",
      "evening sunshine which shone backward to its remembered morning: sin\r\n",
      "seemed to be a question of doctrine and inward penitence, humiliation\r\n",
      "an exercise of the closet, the bearing of his deeds a matter of private\r\n",
      "vision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the\r\n",
      "divine purposes. And now, as if by some hideous magic, this loud red\r\n",
      "figure had risen before him in unmanageable solidity—an incorporate\r\n",
      "past which had not entered into his imagination of chastisements. But\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode’s thought was busy, and he was not a man to act or speak\r\n",
      "rashly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was going home,” he said, “but I can defer my ride a little. And you\r\n",
      "can, if you please, rest here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Raffles, making a grimace. “I don’t care now about\r\n",
      "seeing my stepson. I’d rather go home with you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your stepson, if Mr. Rigg Featherstone was he, is here no longer. I am\r\n",
      "master here now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raffles opened wide eyes, and gave a long whistle of surprise, before\r\n",
      "he said, “Well then, I’ve no objection. I’ve had enough walking from\r\n",
      "the coach-road. I never was much of a walker, or rider either. What I\r\n",
      "like is a smart vehicle and a spirited cob. I was always a little heavy\r\n",
      "in the saddle. What a pleasant surprise it must be to you to see me,\r\n",
      "old fellow!” he continued, as they turned towards the house. “You don’t\r\n",
      "say so; but you never took your luck heartily—you were always thinking\r\n",
      "of improving the occasion—you’d such a gift for improving your luck.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his own wit, and swung his leg in a\r\n",
      "swaggering manner which was rather too much for his companion’s\r\n",
      "judicious patience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I remember rightly,” Mr. Bulstrode observed, with chill anger, “our\r\n",
      "acquaintance many years ago had not the sort of intimacy which you are\r\n",
      "now assuming, Mr. Raffles. Any services you desire of me will be the\r\n",
      "more readily rendered if you will avoid a tone of familiarity which did\r\n",
      "not lie in our former intercourse, and can hardly be warranted by more\r\n",
      "than twenty years of separation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t like being called Nick? Why, I always called you Nick in my\r\n",
      "heart, and though lost to sight, to memory dear. By Jove! my feelings\r\n",
      "have ripened for you like fine old cognac. I hope you’ve got some in\r\n",
      "the house now. Josh filled my flask well the last time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for cognac\r\n",
      "was not stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment, and that a hint\r\n",
      "of annoyance always served him as a fresh cue. But it was at least\r\n",
      "clear that further objection was useless, and Mr. Bulstrode, in giving\r\n",
      "orders to the housekeeper for the accommodation of the guest, had a\r\n",
      "resolute air of quietude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been in the\r\n",
      "service of Rigg also, and might accept the idea that Mr. Bulstrode\r\n",
      "entertained Raffles merely as a friend of her former master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When there was food and drink spread before his visitor in the\r\n",
      "wainscoted parlor, and no witness in the room, Mr. Bulstrode said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your habits and mine are so different, Mr. Raffles, that we can hardly\r\n",
      "enjoy each other’s society. The wisest plan for both of us will\r\n",
      "therefore be to part as soon as possible. Since you say that you wished\r\n",
      "to meet me, you probably considered that you had some business to\r\n",
      "transact with me. But under the circumstances I will invite you to\r\n",
      "remain here for the night, and I will myself ride over here early\r\n",
      "to-morrow morning—before breakfast, in fact—when I can receive any\r\n",
      "communication you have to make to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With all my heart,” said Raffles; “this is a comfortable place—a\r\n",
      "little dull for a continuance; but I can put up with it for a night,\r\n",
      "with this good liquor and the prospect of seeing you again in the\r\n",
      "morning. You’re a much better host than my stepson was; but Josh owed\r\n",
      "me a bit of a grudge for marrying his mother; and between you and me\r\n",
      "there was never anything but kindness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and\r\n",
      "sneering in Raffles’ manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had\r\n",
      "determined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more words\r\n",
      "upon him. But he rode home with a terribly lucid vision of the\r\n",
      "difficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be\r\n",
      "permanently counted on with this man. It was inevitable that he should\r\n",
      "wish to get rid of John Raffles, though his reappearance could not be\r\n",
      "regarded as lying outside the divine plan. The spirit of evil might\r\n",
      "have sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode’s subversion as an instrument\r\n",
      "of good; but the threat must have been permitted, and was a\r\n",
      "chastisement of a new kind. It was an hour of anguish for him very\r\n",
      "different from the hours in which his struggle had been securely\r\n",
      "private, and which had ended with a sense that his secret misdeeds were\r\n",
      "pardoned and his services accepted. Those misdeeds even when\r\n",
      "committed—had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his\r\n",
      "desire to devote himself and all he possessed to the furtherance of the\r\n",
      "divine scheme? And was he after all to become a mere stone of stumbling\r\n",
      "and a rock of offence? For who would understand the work within him?\r\n",
      "Who would not, when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him,\r\n",
      "confound his whole life and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of\r\n",
      "obloquy?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In his closest meditations the life-long habit of Mr. Bulstrode’s mind\r\n",
      "clad his most egoistic terrors in doctrinal references to superhuman\r\n",
      "ends. But even while we are talking and meditating about the earth’s\r\n",
      "orbit and the solar system, what we feel and adjust our movements to is\r\n",
      "the stable earth and the changing day. And now within all the automatic\r\n",
      "succession of theoretic phrases—distinct and inmost as the shiver and\r\n",
      "the ache of oncoming fever when we are discussing abstract pain, was\r\n",
      "the forecast of disgrace in the presence of his neighbors and of his\r\n",
      "own wife. For the pain, as well as the public estimate of disgrace,\r\n",
      "depends on the amount of previous profession. To men who only aim at\r\n",
      "escaping felony, nothing short of the prisoner’s dock is disgrace. But\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent Christian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not more than half-past seven in the morning when he again\r\n",
      "reached Stone Court. The fine old place never looked more like a\r\n",
      "delightful home than at that moment; the great white lilies were in\r\n",
      "flower, the nasturtiums, their pretty leaves all silvered with dew,\r\n",
      "were running away over the low stone wall; the very noises all around\r\n",
      "had a heart of peace within them. But everything was spoiled for the\r\n",
      "owner as he walked on the gravel in front and awaited the descent of\r\n",
      "Mr. Raffles, with whom he was condemned to breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not long before they were seated together in the wainscoted\r\n",
      "parlor over their tea and toast, which was as much as Raffles cared to\r\n",
      "take at that early hour. The difference between his morning and evening\r\n",
      "self was not so great as his companion had imagined that it might be;\r\n",
      "the delight in tormenting was perhaps even the stronger because his\r\n",
      "spirits were rather less highly pitched. Certainly his manners seemed\r\n",
      "more disagreeable by the morning light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As I have little time to spare, Mr. Raffles,” said the banker, who\r\n",
      "could hardly do more than sip his tea and break his toast without\r\n",
      "eating it, “I shall be obliged if you will mention at once the ground\r\n",
      "on which you wished to meet with me. I presume that you have a home\r\n",
      "elsewhere and will be glad to return to it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn’t he want to see an old friend,\r\n",
      "Nick?—I must call you Nick—we always did call you young Nick when we\r\n",
      "knew you meant to marry the old widow. Some said you had a handsome\r\n",
      "family likeness to old Nick, but that was your mother’s fault, calling\r\n",
      "you Nicholas. Aren’t you glad to see me again? I expected an invite to\r\n",
      "stay with you at some pretty place. My own establishment is broken up\r\n",
      "now my wife’s dead. I’ve no particular attachment to any spot; I would\r\n",
      "as soon settle hereabout as anywhere.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I ask why you returned from America? I considered that the strong\r\n",
      "wish you expressed to go there, when an adequate sum was furnished, was\r\n",
      "tantamount to an engagement that you would remain there for life.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never knew that a wish to go to a place was the same thing as a wish\r\n",
      "to stay. But I did stay a matter of ten years; it didn’t suit me to\r\n",
      "stay any longer. And I’m not going again, Nick.” Here Mr. Raffles\r\n",
      "winked slowly as he looked at Mr. Bulstrode.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you wish to be settled in any business? What is your calling now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you, my calling is to enjoy myself as much as I can. I don’t\r\n",
      "care about working any more. If I did anything it would be a little\r\n",
      "travelling in the tobacco line—or something of that sort, which takes a\r\n",
      "man into agreeable company. But not without an independence to fall\r\n",
      "back upon. That’s what I want: I’m not so strong as I was, Nick, though\r\n",
      "I’ve got more color than you. I want an independence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That could be supplied to you, if you would engage to keep at a\r\n",
      "distance,” said Mr. Bulstrode, perhaps with a little too much eagerness\r\n",
      "in his undertone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That must be as it suits my convenience,” said Raffles coolly. “I see\r\n",
      "no reason why I shouldn’t make a few acquaintances hereabout. I’m not\r\n",
      "ashamed of myself as company for anybody. I dropped my portmanteau at\r\n",
      "the turnpike when I got down—change of linen—genuine—honor bright—more\r\n",
      "than fronts and wristbands; and with this suit of mourning, straps and\r\n",
      "everything, I should do you credit among the nobs here.” Mr. Raffles\r\n",
      "had pushed away his chair and looked down at himself, particularly at\r\n",
      "his straps. His chief intention was to annoy Bulstrode, but he really\r\n",
      "thought that his appearance now would produce a good effect, and that\r\n",
      "he was not only handsome and witty, but clad in a mourning style which\r\n",
      "implied solid connections.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you intend to rely on me in any way, Mr. Raffles,” said Bulstrode,\r\n",
      "after a moment’s pause, “you will expect to meet my wishes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, to be sure,” said Raffles, with a mocking cordiality. “Didn’t I\r\n",
      "always do it? Lord, you made a pretty thing out of me, and I got but\r\n",
      "little. I’ve often thought since, I might have done better by telling\r\n",
      "the old woman that I’d found her daughter and her grandchild: it would\r\n",
      "have suited my feelings better; I’ve got a soft place in my heart. But\r\n",

      "was worse than a nightmare, because it held the certitude that it was\r\n",
      "not a nightmare, but a waking misery. Mr. Bulstrode felt a shuddering\r\n",
      "nausea, and did not speak, but was considering diligently whether he\r\n",
      "should not leave Raffles to do as he would, and simply defy him as a\r\n",

      "direct falsehood of denying true statements. It was one thing to look\r\n",
      "back on forgiven sins, nay, to explain questionable conformity to lax\r\n",

      "falsehood.\r\n",

      "back—a nice woman in the tobacco trade—very fond of me—but the trade\r\n",
      "was restricted, as we say. She had been settled there a good many years\r\n",

      "there was an evident selection of statements, as if they had been so\r\n",

      "bright!—pick up my portmanteau and go away. But I shall not give up my\r\n",
      "liberty for a dirty annuity. I shall come and go where I like. Perhaps\r\n",

      "repose to be won on any terms. He was rising to do what Raffles\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I did have another look after Sarah again, though I didn’t tell you;\r\n",
      "I’d a tender conscience about that pretty young woman. I didn’t find\r\n",

      "hang it, I lost my pocketbook. However, if I heard it, I should know it\r\n",
      "again. I’ve got my faculties as if I was in my prime, but names wear\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "occurred to him in his invention of annoyances for Bulstrode.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It began with L; it was almost all l’s I fancy,” he went on, with a\r\n",
      "sense that he was getting hold of the slippery name. But the hold was\r\n",
      "too slight, and he soon got tired of this mental chase; for few men\r\n",
      "were more impatient of private occupation or more in need of making\r\n",

      "time in pleasant conversation with the bailiff and the housekeeper,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "After all, however, there was a dull space of time which needed\r\n",
      "relieving with bread and cheese and ale, and when he was seated alone\r\n",
      "with these resources in the wainscoted parlor, he suddenly slapped his\r\n",
      "knee, and exclaimed, “Ladislaw!” That action of memory which he had\r\n",
      "tried to set going, and had abandoned in despair, had suddenly\r\n",
      "completed itself without conscious effort—a common experience,\r\n",
      "agreeable as a completed sneeze, even if the name remembered is of no\r\n",
      "value. Raffles immediately took out his pocket-book, and wrote down the\r\n",
      "name, not because he expected to use it, but merely for the sake of not\r\n",
      "being at a loss if he ever did happen to want it. He was not going to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He was satisfied with his present success, and by three o’clock that\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "had really determined her to come to Lowick. The longing was to see\r\n",
      "Will Ladislaw. She did not know any good that could come of their\r\n",
      "meeting: she was helpless; her hands had been tied from making up to\r\n",
      "him for any unfairness in his lot. But her soul thirsted to see him.\r\n",
      "How could it be otherwise? If a princess in the days of enchantment had\r\n",
      "seen a four-footed creature from among those which live in herds come\r\n",
      "to her once and again with a human gaze which rested upon her with\r\n",
      "choice and beseeching, what would she think of in her journeying, what\r\n",
      "would she look for when the herds passed her? Surely for the gaze which\r\n",
      "had found her, and which she would know again. Life would be no better\r\n",
      "than candle-light tinsel and daylight rubbish if our spirits were not\r\n",
      "touched by what has been, to issues of longing and constancy. It was\r\n",
      "true that Dorothea wanted to know the Farebrothers better, and\r\n",
      "especially to talk to the new rector, but also true that remembering\r\n",
      "what Lydgate had told her about Will Ladislaw and little Miss Noble,\r\n",
      "she counted on Will’s coming to Lowick to see the Farebrother family.\r\n",
      "The very first Sunday, _before_ she entered the church, she saw him as\r\n",
      "she had seen him the last time she was there, alone in the clergyman’s\r\n",
      "pew; but _when_ she entered his figure was gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the week-days when she went to see the ladies at the Rectory, she\r\n",
      "listened in vain for some word that they might let fall about Will; but\r\n",
      "it seemed to her that Mrs. Farebrother talked of every one else in the\r\n",
      "neighborhood and out of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Probably some of Mr. Farebrother’s Middlemarch hearers may follow him\r\n",
      "to Lowick sometimes. Do you not think so?” said Dorothea, rather\r\n",
      "despising herself for having a secret motive in asking the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If they are wise they will, Mrs. Casaubon,” said the old lady. “I see\r\n",
      "that you set a right value on my son’s preaching. His grandfather on my\r\n",
      "side was an excellent clergyman, but his father was in the law:—most\r\n",
      "exemplary and honest nevertheless, which is a reason for our never\r\n",
      "being rich. They say Fortune is a woman and capricious. But sometimes\r\n",
      "she is a good woman and gives to those who merit, which has been the\r\n",
      "case with you, Mrs. Casaubon, who have given a living to my son.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Farebrother recurred to her knitting with a dignified satisfaction\r\n",
      "in her neat little effort at oratory, but this was not what Dorothea\r\n",
      "wanted to hear. Poor thing! she did not even know whether Will Ladislaw\r\n",
      "was still at Middlemarch, and there was no one whom she dared to ask,\r\n",
      "unless it were Lydgate. But just now she could not see Lydgate without\r\n",
      "sending for him or going to seek him. Perhaps Will Ladislaw, having\r\n",
      "heard of that strange ban against him left by Mr. Casaubon, had felt it\r\n",
      "better that he and she should not meet again, and perhaps she was wrong\r\n",
      "to wish for a meeting that others might find many good reasons against.\r\n",
      "Still “I do wish it” came at the end of those wise reflections as\r\n",
      "naturally as a sob after holding the breath. And the meeting did\r\n",
      "happen, but in a formal way quite unexpected by her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One morning, about eleven, Dorothea was seated in her boudoir with a\r\n",
      "map of the land attached to the manor and other papers before her,\r\n",
      "which were to help her in making an exact statement for herself of her\r\n",
      "income and affairs. She had not yet applied herself to her work, but\r\n",
      "was seated with her hands folded on her lap, looking out along the\r\n",
      "avenue of limes to the distant fields. Every leaf was at rest in the\r\n",
      "sunshine, the familiar scene was changeless, and seemed to represent\r\n",
      "the prospect of her life, full of motiveless ease—motiveless, if her\r\n",
      "own energy could not seek out reasons for ardent action. The widow’s\r\n",
      "cap of those times made an oval frame for the face, and had a crown\r\n",
      "standing up; the dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of\r\n",
      "crape; but this heavy solemnity of clothing made her face look all the\r\n",
      "younger, with its recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of\r\n",
      "her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her reverie was broken by Tantripp, who came to say that Mr. Ladislaw\r\n",
      "was below, and begged permission to see Madam if it were not too early.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will see him,” said Dorothea, rising immediately. “Let him be shown\r\n",
      "into the drawing-room.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The drawing-room was the most neutral room in the house to her—the one\r\n",
      "least associated with the trials of her married life: the damask\r\n",
      "matched the wood-work, which was all white and gold; there were two\r\n",
      "tall mirrors and tables with nothing on them—in brief, it was a room\r\n",
      "where you had no reason for sitting in one place rather than in\r\n",
      "another. It was below the boudoir, and had also a bow-window looking\r\n",
      "out on the avenue. But when Pratt showed Will Ladislaw into it the\r\n",
      "window was open; and a winged visitor, buzzing in and out now and then\r\n",
      "without minding the furniture, made the room look less formal and\r\n",
      "uninhabited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Glad to see you here again, sir,” said Pratt, lingering to adjust a\r\n",
      "blind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am only come to say good-by, Pratt,” said Will, who wished even the\r\n",
      "butler to know that he was too proud to hang about Mrs. Casaubon now\r\n",
      "she was a rich widow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very sorry to hear it, sir,” said Pratt, retiring. Of course, as a\r\n",
      "servant who was to be told nothing, he knew the fact of which Ladislaw\r\n",
      "was still ignorant, and had drawn his inferences; indeed, had not\r\n",
      "differed from his betrothed Tantripp when she said, “Your master was as\r\n",
      "jealous as a fiend—and no reason. Madam would look higher than Mr.\r\n",
      "Ladislaw, else I don’t know her. Mrs. Cadwallader’s maid says there’s a\r\n",
      "lord coming who is to marry her when the mourning’s over.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were not many moments for Will to walk about with his hat in his\r\n",
      "hand before Dorothea entered. The meeting was very different from that\r\n",
      "first meeting in Rome when Will had been embarrassed and Dorothea calm.\r\n",
      "This time he felt miserable but determined, while she was in a state of\r\n",
      "agitation which could not be hidden. Just outside the door she had felt\r\n",
      "that this longed-for meeting was after all too difficult, and when she\r\n",
      "saw Will advancing towards her, the deep blush which was rare in her\r\n",
      "came with painful suddenness. Neither of them knew how it was, but\r\n",
      "neither of them spoke. She gave her hand for a moment, and then they\r\n",
      "went to sit down near the window, she on one settee and he on another\r\n",
      "opposite. Will was peculiarly uneasy: it seemed to him not like\r\n",
      "Dorothea that the mere fact of her being a widow should cause such a\r\n",
      "change in her manner of receiving him; and he knew of no other\r\n",
      "condition which could have affected their previous relation to each\r\n",
      "other—except that, as his imagination at once told him, her friends\r\n",
      "might have been poisoning her mind with their suspicions of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope I have not presumed too much in calling,” said Will; “I could\r\n",
      "not bear to leave the neighborhood and begin a new life without seeing\r\n",
      "you to say good-by.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Presumed? Surely not. I should have thought it unkind if you had not\r\n",
      "wished to see me,” said Dorothea, her habit of speaking with perfect\r\n",
      "genuineness asserting itself through all her uncertainty and agitation.\r\n",
      "“Are you going away immediately?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very soon, I think. I intend to go to town and eat my dinners as a\r\n",
      "barrister, since, they say, that is the preparation for all public\r\n",
      "business. There will be a great deal of political work to be done\r\n",
      "by-and-by, and I mean to try and do some of it. Other men have managed\r\n",
      "to win an honorable position for themselves without family or money.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And that will make it all the more honorable,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "ardently. “Besides, you have so many talents. I have heard from my\r\n",
      "uncle how well you speak in public, so that every one is sorry when you\r\n",
      "leave off, and how clearly you can explain things. And you care that\r\n",
      "justice should be done to every one. I am so glad. When we were in\r\n",
      "Rome, I thought you only cared for poetry and art, and the things that\r\n",
      "adorn life for us who are well off. But now I know you think about the\r\n",
      "rest of the world.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While she was speaking Dorothea had lost her personal embarrassment,\r\n",
      "and had become like her former self. She looked at Will with a direct\r\n",
      "glance, full of delighted confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here\r\n",
      "again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?” said Will,\r\n",
      "trying hard to reconcile the utmost pride with the utmost effort to get\r\n",
      "an expression of strong feeling from Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was not aware how long it was before she answered. She had turned\r\n",
      "her head and was looking out of the window on the rose-bushes, which\r\n",
      "seemed to have in them the summers of all the years when Will would be\r\n",
      "away. This was not judicious behavior. But Dorothea never thought of\r\n",
      "studying her manners: she thought only of bowing to a sad necessity\r\n",
      "which divided her from Will. Those first words of his about his\r\n",
      "intentions had seemed to make everything clear to her: he knew, she\r\n",
      "supposed, all about Mr. Casaubon’s final conduct in relation to him,\r\n",
      "and it had come to him with the same sort of shock as to herself. He\r\n",
      "had never felt more than friendship for her—had never had anything in\r\n",
      "his mind to justify what she felt to be her husband’s outrage on the\r\n",
      "feelings of both: and that friendship he still felt. Something which\r\n",
      "may be called an inward silent sob had gone on in Dorothea before she\r\n",
      "said with a pure voice, just trembling in the last words as if only\r\n",
      "from its liquid flexibility—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say. I shall be very happy\r\n",
      "when I hear that you have made your value felt. But you must have\r\n",
      "patience. It will perhaps be a long while.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will never quite knew how it was that he saved himself from falling\r\n",
      "down at her feet, when the “long while” came forth with its gentle\r\n",
      "tremor. He used to say that the horrible hue and surface of her crape\r\n",
      "dress was most likely the sufficient controlling force. He sat still,\r\n",
      "however, and only said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall never hear from you. And you will forget all about me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Dorothea, “I shall never forget you. I have never forgotten\r\n",
      "any one whom I once knew. My life has never been crowded, and seems not\r\n",
      "likely to be so. And I have a great deal of space for memory at Lowick,\r\n",
      "haven’t I?” She smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good God!” Will burst out passionately, rising, with his hat still in\r\n",
      "his hand, and walking away to a marble table, where he suddenly turned\r\n",
      "and leaned his back against it. The blood had mounted to his face and\r\n",
      "neck, and he looked almost angry. It had seemed to him as if they were\r\n",
      "like two creatures slowly turning to marble in each other’s presence,\r\n",
      "while their hearts were conscious and their eyes were yearning. But\r\n",
      "there was no help for it. It should never be true of him that in this\r\n",
      "meeting to which he had come with bitter resolution he had ended by a\r\n",
      "confession which might be interpreted into asking for her fortune.\r\n",
      "Moreover, it was actually true that he was fearful of the effect which\r\n",
      "such confessions might have on Dorothea herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked at him from that distance in some trouble, imagining that\r\n",
      "there might have been an offence in her words. But all the while there\r\n",
      "was a current of thought in her about his probable want of money, and\r\n",
      "the impossibility of her helping him. If her uncle had been at home,\r\n",
      "something might have been done through him! It was this preoccupation\r\n",
      "with the hardship of Will’s wanting money, while she had what ought to\r\n",
      "have been his share, which led her to say, seeing that he remained\r\n",
      "silent and looked away from her—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wonder whether you would like to have that miniature which hangs\r\n",
      "up-stairs—I mean that beautiful miniature of your grandmother. I think\r\n",
      "it is not right for me to keep it, if you would wish to have it. It is\r\n",
      "wonderfully like you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are very good,” said Will, irritably. “No; I don’t mind about it.\r\n",
      "It is not very consoling to have one’s own likeness. It would be more\r\n",
      "consoling if others wanted to have it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought you would like to cherish her memory—I thought—” Dorothea\r\n",
      "broke off an instant, her imagination suddenly warning her away from\r\n",
      "Aunt Julia’s history—“you would surely like to have the miniature as a\r\n",
      "family memorial.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should I have that, when I have nothing else! A man with only a\r\n",
      "portmanteau for his stowage must keep his memorials in his head.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will spoke at random: he was merely venting his petulance; it was a\r\n",
      "little too exasperating to have his grandmother’s portrait offered him\r\n",
      "at that moment. But to Dorothea’s feeling his words had a peculiar\r\n",
      "sting. She rose and said with a touch of indignation as well as\r\n",
      "hauteur—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are much the happier of us two, Mr. Ladislaw, to have nothing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was startled. Whatever the words might be, the tone seemed like a\r\n",
      "dismissal; and quitting his leaning posture, he walked a little way\r\n",
      "towards her. Their eyes met, but with a strange questioning gravity.\r\n",
      "Something was keeping their minds aloof, and each was left to\r\n",
      "conjecture what was in the other. Will had really never thought of\r\n",
      "himself as having a claim of inheritance on the property which was held\r\n",
      "by Dorothea, and would have required a narrative to make him understand\r\n",
      "her present feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I never felt it a misfortune to have nothing till now,” he said. “But\r\n",
      "poverty may be as bad as leprosy, if it divides us from what we most\r\n",
      "care for.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The words cut Dorothea to the heart, and made her relent. She answered\r\n",
      "in a tone of sad fellowship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sorrow comes in so many ways. Two years ago I had no notion of that—I\r\n",
      "mean of the unexpected way in which trouble comes, and ties our hands,\r\n",
      "and makes us silent when we long to speak. I used to despise women a\r\n",
      "little for not shaping their lives more, and doing better things. I was\r\n",
      "very fond of doing as I liked, but I have almost given it up,” she\r\n",
      "ended, smiling playfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have not given up doing as I like, but I can very seldom do it,”\r\n",
      "said Will. He was standing two yards from her with his mind full of\r\n",
      "contradictory desires and resolves—desiring some unmistakable proof\r\n",
      "that she loved him, and yet dreading the position into which such a\r\n",
      "proof might bring him. “The thing one most longs for may be surrounded\r\n",
      "with conditions that would be intolerable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment Pratt entered and said, “Sir James Chettam is in the\r\n",
      "library, madam.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ask Sir James to come in here,” said Dorothea, immediately. It was as\r\n",
      "if the same electric shock had passed through her and Will. Each of\r\n",
      "them felt proudly resistant, and neither looked at the other, while\r\n",
      "they awaited Sir James’s entrance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After shaking hands with Dorothea, he bowed as slightly as possible to\r\n",
      "Ladislaw, who repaid the slightness exactly, and then going towards\r\n",

      "“I must say good-by, Mrs. Casaubon; and probably for a long while.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea put out her hand and said her good-by cordially. The sense\r\n",
      "that Sir James was depreciating Will, and behaving rudely to him,\r\n",
      "roused her resolution and dignity: there was no touch of confusion in\r\n",
      "her manner. And when Will had left the room, she looked with such calm\r\n",
      "self-possession at Sir James, saying, “How is Celia?” that he was\r\n",
      "obliged to behave as if nothing had annoyed him. And what would be the\r\n",
      "use of behaving otherwise? Indeed, Sir James shrank with so much\r\n",
      "dislike from the association even in thought of Dorothea with Ladislaw\r\n",
      "as her possible lover, that he would himself have wished to avoid an\r\n",
      "outward show of displeasure which would have recognized the\r\n",
      "disagreeable possibility. If any one had asked him why he shrank in\r\n",
      "that way, I am not sure that he would at first have said anything\r\n",
      "fuller or more precise than “_That_ Ladislaw!”—though on reflection he\r\n",
      "might have urged that Mr. Casaubon’s codicil, barring Dorothea’s\r\n",
      "marriage with Will, except under a penalty, was enough to cast\r\n",
      "unfitness over any relation at all between them. His aversion was all\r\n",
      "the stronger because he felt himself unable to interfere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Sir James was a power in a way unguessed by himself. Entering at\r\n",
      "that moment, he was an incorporation of the strongest reasons through\r\n",
      "which Will’s pride became a repellent force, keeping him asunder from\r\n",

      "before her, liking to blend the woman who had been too hardly judged\r\n",
      "with the grandson whom her own heart and judgment defended. Can any one\r\n",
      "who has rejoiced in woman’s tenderness think it a reproach to her that\r\n",
      "she took the little oval picture in her palm and made a bed for it\r\n",
      "there, and leaned her cheek upon it, as if that would soothe the\r\n",
      "creatures who had suffered unjust condemnation? She did not know then\r\n",
      "that it was Love who had come to her briefly, as in a dream before\r\n",
      "awaking, with the hues of morning on his wings—that it was Love to whom\r\n",
      "she was sobbing her farewell as his image was banished by the blameless\r\n",
      "rigor of irresistible day. She only felt that there was something\r\n",
      "irrevocably amiss and lost in her lot, and her thoughts about the\r\n",
      "future were the more readily shapen into resolve. Ardent souls, ready\r\n",
      "to construct their coming lives, are apt to commit themselves to the\r\n",
      "fulfilment of their own visions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day that she went to Freshitt to fulfil her promise of staying all\r\n",
      "night and seeing baby washed, Mrs. Cadwallader came to dine, the Rector\r\n",
      "being gone on a fishing excursion. It was a warm evening, and even in\r\n",
      "the delightful drawing-room, where the fine old turf sloped from the\r\n",
      "open window towards a lilied pool and well-planted mounds, the heat was\r\n",
      "enough to make Celia in her white muslin and light curls reflect with\r\n",
      "pity on what Dodo must feel in her black dress and close cap. But this\r\n",
      "was not until some episodes with baby were over, and had left her mind\r\n",
      "at leisure. She had seated herself and taken up a fan for some time\r\n",
      "before she said, in her quiet guttural—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear Dodo, do throw off that cap. I am sure your dress must make you\r\n",
      "feel ill.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am so used to the cap—it has become a sort of shell,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "smiling. “I feel rather bare and exposed when it is off.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must see you without it; it makes us all warm,” said Celia, throwing\r\n",
      "down her fan, and going to Dorothea. It was a pretty picture to see\r\n",
      "this little lady in white muslin unfastening the widow’s cap from her\r\n",
      "more majestic sister, and tossing it on to a chair. Just as the coils\r\n",
      "and braids of dark-brown hair had been set free, Sir James entered the\r\n",
      "room. He looked at the released head, and said, “Ah!” in a tone of\r\n",
      "satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was I who did it, James,” said Celia. “Dodo need not make such a\r\n",
      "slavery of her mourning; she need not wear that cap any more among her\r\n",
      "friends.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Celia,” said Lady Chettam, “a widow must wear her mourning at\r\n",
      "least a year.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not if she marries again before the end of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader,\r\n",
      "who had some pleasure in startling her good friend the Dowager. Sir\r\n",
      "James was annoyed, and leaned forward to play with Celia’s Maltese dog.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is very rare, I hope,” said Lady Chettam, in a tone intended to\r\n",
      "guard against such events. “No friend of ours ever committed herself in\r\n",
      "that way except Mrs. Beevor, and it was very painful to Lord Grinsell\r\n",
      "when she did so. Her first husband was objectionable, which made it the\r\n",
      "greater wonder. And severely she was punished for it. They said Captain\r\n",
      "Beevor dragged her about by the hair, and held up loaded pistols at\r\n",
      "her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, if she took the wrong man!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who was in a\r\n",
      "decidedly wicked mood. “Marriage is always bad then, first or second.\r\n",
      "Priority is a poor recommendation in a husband if he has got no other.\r\n",
      "I would rather have a good second husband than an indifferent first.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear, your clever tongue runs away with you,” said Lady Chettam. “I\r\n",
      "am sure you would be the last woman to marry again prematurely, if our\r\n",
      "dear Rector were taken away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I make no vows; it might be a necessary economy. It is lawful to\r\n",
      "marry again, I suppose; else we might as well be Hindoos instead of\r\n",
      "Christians. Of course if a woman accepts the wrong man, she must take\r\n",
      "the consequences, and one who does it twice over deserves her fate. But\r\n",
      "if she can marry blood, beauty, and bravery—the sooner the better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think the subject of our conversation is very ill-chosen,” said Sir\r\n",
      "James, with a look of disgust. “Suppose we change it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not on my account, Sir James,” said Dorothea, determined not to lose\r\n",
      "the opportunity of freeing herself from certain oblique references to\r\n",
      "excellent matches. “If you are speaking on my behalf, I can assure you\r\n",
      "that no question can be more indifferent and impersonal to me than\r\n",
      "second marriage. It is no more to me than if you talked of women going\r\n",
      "fox-hunting: whether it is admirable in them or not, I shall not follow\r\n",
      "them. Pray let Mrs. Cadwallader amuse herself on that subject as much\r\n",
      "as on any other.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Mrs. Casaubon,” said Lady Chettam, in her stateliest way, “you\r\n",
      "do not, I hope, think there was any allusion to you in my mentioning\r\n",
      "Mrs. Beevor. It was only an instance that occurred to me. She was\r\n",
      "step-daughter to Lord Grinsell: he married Mrs. Teveroy for his second\r\n",
      "wife. There could be no possible allusion to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no,” said Celia. “Nobody chose the subject; it all came out of\r\n",
      "Dodo’s cap. Mrs. Cadwallader only said what was quite true. A woman\r\n",
      "could not be married in a widow’s cap, James.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hush, my dear!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “I will not offend again. I\r\n",
      "will not even refer to Dido or Zenobia. Only what are we to talk about?\r\n",
      "I, for my part, object to the discussion of Human Nature, because that\r\n",
      "is the nature of rectors’ wives.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Later in the evening, after Mrs. Cadwallader was gone, Celia said\r\n",
      "privately to Dorothea, “Really, Dodo, taking your cap off made you like\r\n",
      "yourself again in more ways than one. You spoke up just as you used to\r\n",
      "do, when anything was said to displease you. But I could hardly make\r\n",
      "out whether it was James that you thought wrong, or Mrs. Cadwallader.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Neither,” said Dorothea. “James spoke out of delicacy to me, but he\r\n",
      "was mistaken in supposing that I minded what Mrs. Cadwallader said. I\r\n",
      "should only mind if there were a law obliging me to take any piece of\r\n",
      "blood and beauty that she or anybody else recommended.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you know, Dodo, if you ever did marry, it would be all the better\r\n",
      "to have blood and beauty,” said Celia, reflecting that Mr. Casaubon had\r\n",
      "not been richly endowed with those gifts, and that it would be well to\r\n",
      "caution Dorothea in time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be anxious, Kitty; I have quite other thoughts about my life. I\r\n",
      "shall never marry again,” said Dorothea, touching her sister’s chin,\r\n",
      "and looking at her with indulgent affection. Celia was nursing her\r\n",
      "baby, and Dorothea had come to say good-night to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Really—quite?” said Celia. “Not anybody at all—if he were very\r\n",
      "wonderful indeed?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea shook her head slowly. “Not anybody at all. I have delightful\r\n",
      "plans. I should like to take a great deal of land, and drain it, and\r\n",
      "make a little colony, where everybody should work, and all the work\r\n",
      "should be done well. I should know every one of the people and be their\r\n",
      "friend. I am going to have great consultations with Mr. Garth: he can\r\n",
      "tell me almost everything I want to know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you _will_ be happy, if you have a plan, Dodo?” said Celia.\r\n",
      "“Perhaps little Arthur will like plans when he grows up, and then he\r\n",
      "can help you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James was informed that same night that Dorothea was really quite\r\n",
      "set against marrying anybody at all, and was going to take to “all\r\n",
      "sorts of plans,” just like what she used to have. Sir James made no\r\n",
      "remark. To his secret feeling there was something repulsive in a\r\n",
      "woman’s second marriage, and no match would prevent him from feeling it\r\n",
      "a sort of desecration for Dorothea. He was aware that the world would\r\n",
      "regard such a sentiment as preposterous, especially in relation to a\r\n",
      "woman of one-and-twenty; the practice of “the world” being to treat of\r\n",
      "a young widow’s second marriage as certain and probably near, and to\r\n",
      "smile with meaning if the widow acts accordingly. But if Dorothea did\r\n",

      "lived to be old, that I had improved a great piece of land and built a\r\n",

      "music. Bless me! it reminds me of bits in the ‘Messiah’—‘and\r\n",

      "language into his outstretched hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this good understanding between them, it was natural that Dorothea\r\n",
      "asked Mr. Garth to undertake any business connected with the three\r\n",
      "farms and the numerous tenements attached to Lowick Manor; indeed, his\r\n",
      "expectation of getting work for two was being fast fulfilled. As he\r\n",
      "said, “Business breeds.” And one form of business which was beginning\r\n",
      "to breed just then was the construction of railways. A projected line\r\n",
      "was to run through Lowick parish where the cattle had hitherto grazed\r\n",
      "in a peace unbroken by astonishment; and thus it happened that the\r\n",
      "infant struggles of the railway system entered into the affairs of\r\n",
      "Caleb Garth, and determined the course of this history with regard to\r\n",
      "two persons who were dear to him. The submarine railway may have its\r\n",
      "difficulties; but the bed of the sea is not divided among various\r\n",
      "landed proprietors with claims for damages not only measurable but\r\n",
      "sentimental. In the hundred to which Middlemarch belonged railways were\r\n",
      "as exciting a topic as the Reform Bill or the imminent horrors of\r\n",
      "Cholera, and those who held the most decided views on the subject were\r\n",
      "women and landholders. Women both old and young regarded travelling by\r\n",
      "steam as presumptuous and dangerous, and argued against it by saying\r\n",
      "that nothing should induce them to get into a railway carriage; while\r\n",
      "proprietors, differing from each other in their arguments as much as\r\n",
      "Mr. Solomon Featherstone differed from Lord Medlicote, were yet\r\n",
      "unanimous in the opinion that in selling land, whether to the Enemy of\r\n",
      "mankind or to a company obliged to purchase, these pernicious agencies\r\n",
      "must be made to pay a very high price to landowners for permission to\r\n",
      "injure mankind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the slower wits, such as Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule, who both\r\n",
      "occupied land of their own, took a long time to arrive at this\r\n",
      "conclusion, their minds halting at the vivid conception of what it\r\n",
      "would be to cut the Big Pasture in two, and turn it into three-cornered\r\n",
      "bits, which would be “nohow;” while accommodation-bridges and high\r\n",
      "payments were remote and incredible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The cows will all cast their calves, brother,” said Mrs. Waule, in a\r\n",
      "tone of deep melancholy, “if the railway comes across the Near Close;\r\n",
      "and I shouldn’t wonder at the mare too, if she was in foal. It’s a poor\r\n",
      "tale if a widow’s property is to be spaded away, and the law say\r\n",
      "nothing to it. What’s to hinder ’em from cutting right and left if they\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“The best way would be to say nothing, and set somebody on to send ’em\r\n",
      "away with a flea in their ear, when they came spying and measuring,”\r\n",
      "said Solomon. “Folks did that about Brassing, by what I can understand.\r\n",
      "It’s all a pretence, if the truth was known, about their being forced\r\n",
      "to take one way. Let ’em go cutting in another parish. And I don’t\r\n",
      "believe in any pay to make amends for bringing a lot of ruffians to\r\n",
      "trample your crops. Where’s a company’s pocket?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Brother Peter, God forgive him, got money out of a company,” said Mrs.\r\n",
      "Waule. “But that was for the manganese. That wasn’t for railways to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, there’s this to be said, Jane,” Mr. Solomon concluded, lowering\r\n",
      "his voice in a cautious manner—“the more spokes we put in their wheel,\r\n",
      "the more they’ll pay us to let ’em go on, if they must come whether or\r\n",
      "not.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This reasoning of Mr. Solomon’s was perhaps less thorough than he\r\n",
      "imagined, his cunning bearing about the same relation to the course of\r\n",
      "railways as the cunning of a diplomatist bears to the general chill or\r\n",
      "catarrh of the solar system. But he set about acting on his views in a\r\n",
      "thoroughly diplomatic manner, by stimulating suspicion. His side of\r\n",
      "Lowick was the most remote from the village, and the houses of the\r\n",
      "laboring people were either lone cottages or were collected in a hamlet\r\n",
      "called Frick, where a water-mill and some stone-pits made a little\r\n",
      "centre of slow, heavy-shouldered industry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the absence of any precise idea as to what railways were, public\r\n",
      "opinion in Frick was against them; for the human mind in that grassy\r\n",
      "corner had not the proverbial tendency to admire the unknown, holding\r\n",
      "rather that it was likely to be against the poor man, and that\r\n",
      "suspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it. Even the rumor\r\n",
      "of Reform had not yet excited any millennial expectations in Frick,\r\n",
      "there being no definite promise in it, as of gratuitous grains to\r\n",
      "fatten Hiram Ford’s pig, or of a publican at the “Weights and Scales”\r\n",
      "who would brew beer for nothing, or of an offer on the part of the\r\n",
      "three neighboring farmers to raise wages during winter. And without\r\n",
      "distinct good of this kind in its promises, Reform seemed on a footing\r\n",
      "with the bragging of pedlers, which was a hint for distrust to every\r\n",
      "knowing person. The men of Frick were not ill-fed, and were less given\r\n",
      "to fanaticism than to a strong muscular suspicion; less inclined to\r\n",
      "believe that they were peculiarly cared for by heaven, than to regard\r\n",
      "heaven itself as rather disposed to take them in—a disposition\r\n",
      "observable in the weather.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus the mind of Frick was exactly of the sort for Mr. Solomon\r\n",
      "Featherstone to work upon, he having more plenteous ideas of the same\r\n",
      "order, with a suspicion of heaven and earth which was better fed and\r\n",
      "more entirely at leisure. Solomon was overseer of the roads at that\r\n",
      "time, and on his slow-paced cob often took his rounds by Frick to look\r\n",
      "at the workmen getting the stones there, pausing with a mysterious\r\n",
      "deliberation, which might have misled you into supposing that he had\r\n",
      "some other reason for staying than the mere want of impulse to move.\r\n",
      "After looking for a long while at any work that was going on, he would\r\n",
      "raise his eyes a little and look at the horizon; finally he would shake\r\n",
      "his bridle, touch his horse with the whip, and get it to move slowly\r\n",
      "onward. The hour-hand of a clock was quick by comparison with Mr.\r\n",
      "Solomon, who had an agreeable sense that he could afford to be slow. He\r\n",
      "was in the habit of pausing for a cautious, vaguely designing chat with\r\n",
      "every hedger or ditcher on his way, and was especially willing to\r\n",
      "listen even to news which he had heard before, feeling himself at an\r\n",
      "advantage over all narrators in partially disbelieving them. One day,\r\n",
      "however, he got into a dialogue with Hiram Ford, a wagoner, in which he\r\n",
      "himself contributed information. He wished to know whether Hiram had\r\n",
      "seen fellows with staves and instruments spying about: they called\r\n",
      "themselves railroad people, but there was no telling what they were or\r\n",
      "what they meant to do. The least they pretended was that they were\r\n",
      "going to cut Lowick Parish into sixes and sevens.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, there’ll be no stirrin’ from one pla-ace to another,” said Hiram,\r\n",
      "thinking of his wagon and horses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not a bit,” said Mr. Solomon. “And cutting up fine land such as this\r\n",
      "parish! Let ’em go into Tipton, say I. But there’s no knowing what\r\n",
      "there is at the bottom of it. Traffic is what they put for’ard; but\r\n",
      "it’s to do harm to the land and the poor man in the long-run.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, they’re Lunnon chaps, I reckon,” said Hiram, who had a dim notion\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, to be sure. And in some parts against Brassing, by what I’ve heard\r\n",

      "restricted by circumstances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I wouldn’t meddle with ’em myself,” said Solomon. “But some say\r\n",

      "was discussed, not only at the “Weights and Scales,” but in the\r\n",

      "it happened that her father had some business which took him to\r\n",

      "an outlying piece of land belonging to Lowick Manor, which Caleb\r\n",
      "expected to dispose of advantageously for Dorothea (it must be\r\n",
      "confessed that his bias was towards getting the best possible terms\r\n",

      "walking with his assistant and measuring-chain to the scene of his\r\n",
      "work, he encountered the party of the company’s agents, who were\r\n",

      "observing that by-and-by they would reach him again where he was going\r\n",
      "to measure. It was one of those gray mornings after light rains, which\r\n",

      "and the scent of the earth is sweet along the lanes and by the\r\n",
      "hedgerows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The scent would have been sweeter to Fred Vincy, who was coming along\r\n",

      "unsuccessful efforts to imagine what he was to do, with his father on\r\n",

      "working-day world showing no eager need whatever of a young gentleman\r\n",
      "without capital and generally unskilled. It was the harder to Fred’s\r\n",
      "disposition because his father, satisfied that he was no longer\r\n",
      "rebellious, was in good humor with him, and had sent him on this\r\n",
      "pleasant ride to see after some greyhounds. Even when he had fixed on\r\n",
      "what he should do, there would be the task of telling his father. But\r\n",
      "it must be admitted that the fixing, which had to come first, was the\r\n",
      "more difficult task:—what secular avocation on earth was there for a\r\n",
      "young man (whose friends could not get him an “appointment”) which was\r\n",
      "at once gentlemanly, lucrative, and to be followed without special\r\n",
      "knowledge? Riding along the lanes by Frick in this mood, and slackening\r\n",
      "his pace while he reflected whether he should venture to go round by\r\n",
      "Lowick Parsonage to call on Mary, he could see over the hedges from one\r\n",
      "field to another. Suddenly a noise roused his attention, and on the far\r\n",
      "side of a field on his left hand he could see six or seven men in\r\n",
      "smock-frocks with hay-forks in their hands making an offensive approach\r\n",
      "towards the four railway agents who were facing them, while Caleb Garth\r\n",
      "and his assistant were hastening across the field to join the\r\n",
      "threatened group. Fred, delayed a few moments by having to find the\r\n",
      "gate, could not gallop up to the spot before the party in smock-frocks,\r\n",
      "whose work of turning the hay had not been too pressing after\r\n",
      "swallowing their mid-day beer, were driving the men in coats before\r\n",
      "them with their hay-forks; while Caleb Garth’s assistant, a lad of\r\n",
      "seventeen, who had snatched up the spirit-level at Caleb’s order, had\r\n",
      "been knocked down and seemed to be lying helpless. The coated men had\r\n",
      "the advantage as runners, and Fred covered their retreat by getting in\r\n",
      "front of the smock-frocks and charging them suddenly enough to throw\r\n",
      "their chase into confusion. “What do you confounded fools mean?”\r\n",
      "shouted Fred, pursuing the divided group in a zigzag, and cutting right\r\n",
      "and left with his whip. “I’ll swear to every one of you before the\r\n",
      "magistrate. You’ve knocked the lad down and killed him, for what I\r\n",
      "know. You’ll every one of you be hanged at the next assizes, if you\r\n",
      "don’t mind,” said Fred, who afterwards laughed heartily as he\r\n",
      "remembered his own phrases.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The laborers had been driven through the gate-way into their hay-field,\r\n",
      "and Fred had checked his horse, when Hiram Ford, observing himself at a\r\n",
      "safe challenging distance, turned back and shouted a defiance which he\r\n",
      "did not know to be Homeric.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yo’re a coward, yo are. Yo git off your horse, young measter, and I’ll\r\n",

      "hasten back to Caleb and the prostrate youth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lad’s ankle was strained, and he was in much pain from it, but he\r\n",
      "was no further hurt, and Fred placed him on the horse that he might\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Let them put the horse in the stable, and tell the surveyors they can\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, ay, it was lucky,” said Caleb, speaking rather absently, and\r\n",
      "looking towards the spot where he had been at work at the moment of\r\n",
      "interruption. “But—deuce take it—this is what comes of men being\r\n",
      "fools—I’m hindered of my day’s work. I can’t get along without somebody\r\n",
      "to help me with the measuring-chain. However!” He was beginning to move\r\n",
      "towards the spot with a look of vexation, as if he had forgotten Fred’s\r\n",
      "presence, but suddenly he turned round and said quickly, “What have you\r\n",
      "got to do to-day, young fellow?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, Mr. Garth. I’ll help you with pleasure—can I?” said Fred,\r\n",

      "for him. I shall not be five minutes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense!” said Caleb, with his most peremptory intonation. “I shall\r\n",
      "go and speak to the men myself. It’s all ignorance. Somebody has been\r\n",
      "telling them lies. The poor fools don’t know any better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall go with you, then,” said Fred.\r\n",

      "hurting others and the fear of having to speechify. But he felt it his\r\n",
      "duty at this moment to try and give a little harangue. There was a\r\n",
      "striking mixture in him—which came from his having always been a\r\n",
      "hard-working man himself—of rigorous notions about workmen and\r\n",
      "practical indulgence towards them. To do a good day’s work and to do it\r\n",
      "well, he held to be part of their welfare, as it was the chief part of\r\n",
      "his own happiness; but he had a strong sense of fellowship with them.\r\n",
      "When he advanced towards the laborers they had not gone to work again,\r\n",
      "but were standing in that form of rural grouping which consists in each\r\n",
      "turning a shoulder towards the other, at a distance of two or three\r\n",
      "yards. They looked rather sulkily at Caleb, who walked quickly with one\r\n",
      "hand in his pocket and the other thrust between the buttons of his\r\n",
      "waistcoat, and had his every-day mild air when he paused among them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, my lads, how’s this?” he began, taking as usual to brief phrases,\r\n",
      "which seemed pregnant to himself, because he had many thoughts lying\r\n",
      "under them, like the abundant roots of a plant that just manages to\r\n",
      "peep above the water. “How came you to make such a mistake as this?\r\n",

      "will be made whether you like it or not. And if you go fighting against\r\n",

      "if you meddle with them you’ll have to do with the constable and\r\n",

      "not to be wrought on by any oratory, having as little of the feudal\r\n",
      "spirit, and believing as little, as if he had not been totally\r\n",
      "unacquainted with the Age of Reason and the Rights of Man. Caleb was in\r\n",

      "unassisted by miracle to reason with rustics who are in possession of\r\n",
      "an undeniable truth which they know through a hard process of feeling,\r\n",
      "and can let it fall like a giant’s club on your neatly carved argument\r\n",
      "for a social benefit which they do not feel. Caleb had no cant at\r\n",

      "and he heartily enjoyed a good slip in the moist earth under the\r\n",
      "hedgerow, which soiled his perfect summer trousers. Was it his\r\n",
      "successful onset which had elated him, or the satisfaction of helping\r\n",
      "Mary’s father? Something more. The accidents of the morning had helped\r\n",
      "his frustrated imagination to shape an employment for himself which had\r\n",
      "several attractions. I am not sure that certain fibres in Mr. Garth’s\r\n",
      "mind had not resumed their old vibration towards the very end which now\r\n",
      "revealed itself to Fred. For the effective accident is but the touch of\r\n",
      "fire where there is oil and tow; and it always appeared to Fred that\r\n",
      "the railway brought the needed touch. But they went on in silence\r\n",
      "except when their business demanded speech. At last, when they had\r\n",
      "finished and were walking away, Mr. Garth said—\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“My business is of many sorts, my boy,” said Mr. Garth, smiling. “A\r\n",
      "good deal of what I know can only come from experience: you can’t learn\r\n",
      "it off as you learn things out of a book. But you are young enough to\r\n",
      "lay a foundation yet.” Caleb pronounced the last sentence emphatically,\r\n",
      "but paused in some uncertainty. He had been under the impression lately\r\n",
      "that Fred had made up his mind to enter the Church.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?” said Fred,\r\n",
      "more eagerly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That depends,” said Caleb, turning his head on one side and lowering\r\n",
      "his voice, with the air of a man who felt himself to be saying\r\n",
      "something deeply religious. “You must be sure of two things: you must\r\n",
      "love your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting\r\n",
      "your play to begin. And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your\r\n",
      "work, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something\r\n",
      "else. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it\r\n",
      "well, and not be always saying, There’s this and there’s that—if I had\r\n",
      "this or that to do, I might make something of it. No matter what a man\r\n",
      "is—I wouldn’t give twopence for him”—here Caleb’s mouth looked bitter,\r\n",
      "and he snapped his fingers—“whether he was the prime minister or the\r\n",
      "rick-thatcher, if he didn’t do well what he undertook to do.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That is very nearly what Mary thinks about it,” said Fred, coloring.\r\n",

      "not displease you that I have always loved her better than any one\r\n",
      "else, and that I shall never love any one as I love her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The expression of Caleb’s face was visibly softening while Fred spoke.\r\n",
      "But he swung his head with a solemn slowness, and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That makes things more serious, Fred, if you want to take Mary’s\r\n",
      "happiness into your keeping.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know that, Mr. Garth,” said Fred, eagerly, “and I would do anything\r\n",
      "for _her_. She says she will never have me if I go into the Church; and\r\n",
      "I shall be the most miserable devil in the world if I lose all hope of\r\n",
      "Mary. Really, if I could get some other profession, business—anything\r\n",
      "that I am at all fit for, I would work hard, I would deserve your good\r\n",
      "opinion. I should like to have to do with outdoor things. I know a good\r\n",
      "deal about land and cattle already. I used to believe, you know—though\r\n",
      "you will think me rather foolish for it—that I should have land of my\r\n",
      "own. I am sure knowledge of that sort would come easily to me,\r\n",
      "especially if I could be under you in any way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Softly, my boy,” said Caleb, having the image of “Susan” before his\r\n",
      "eyes. “What have you said to your father about all this?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, yet; but I must tell him. I am only waiting to know what I\r\n",
      "can do instead of entering the Church. I am very sorry to disappoint\r\n",
      "him, but a man ought to be allowed to judge for himself when he is\r\n",
      "four-and-twenty. How could I know when I was fifteen, what it would be\r\n",
      "right for me to do now? My education was a mistake.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But hearken to this, Fred,” said Caleb. “Are you sure Mary is fond of\r\n",
      "you, or would ever have you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I asked Mr. Farebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden me—I\r\n",
      "didn’t know what else to do,” said Fred, apologetically. “And he says\r\n",
      "that I have every reason to hope, if I can put myself in an honorable\r\n",
      "position—I mean, out of the Church. I dare say you think it\r\n",
      "unwarrantable in me, Mr. Garth, to be troubling you and obtruding my\r\n",
      "own wishes about Mary, before I have done anything at all for myself.\r\n",
      "Of course I have not the least claim—indeed, I have already a debt to\r\n",
      "you which will never be discharged, even when I have been able to pay\r\n",
      "it in the shape of money.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, my boy, you have a claim,” said Caleb, with much feeling in his\r\n",
      "voice. “The young ones have always a claim on the old to help them\r\n",
      "forward. I was young myself once and had to do without much help; but\r\n",
      "help would have been welcome to me, if it had been only for the\r\n",
      "fellow-feeling’s sake. But I must consider. Come to me to-morrow at the\r\n",
      "office, at nine o’clock. At the office, mind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Garth would take no important step without consulting Susan, but it\r\n",
      "must be confessed that before he reached home he had taken his\r\n",
      "resolution. With regard to a large number of matters about which other\r\n",
      "men are decided or obstinate, he was the most easily manageable man in\r\n",
      "the world. He never knew what meat he would choose, and if Susan had\r\n",
      "said that they ought to live in a four-roomed cottage, in order to\r\n",
      "save, he would have said, “Let us go,” without inquiring into details.\r\n",
      "But where Caleb’s feeling and judgment strongly pronounced, he was a\r\n",
      "ruler; and in spite of his mildness and timidity in reproving, every\r\n",
      "one about him knew that on the exceptional occasions when he chose, he\r\n",
      "was absolute. He never, indeed, chose to be absolute except on some one\r\n",
      "else’s behalf. On ninety-nine points Mrs. Garth decided, but on the\r\n",
      "hundredth she was often aware that she would have to perform the\r\n",
      "singularly difficult task of carrying out her own principle, and to\r\n",
      "make herself subordinate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is come round as I thought, Susan,” said Caleb, when they were\r\n",
      "seated alone in the evening. He had already narrated the adventure\r\n",
      "which had brought about Fred’s sharing in his work, but had kept back\r\n",
      "the further result. “The children _are_ fond of each other—I mean, Fred\r\n",
      "and Mary.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth laid her work on her knee, and fixed her penetrating eyes\r\n",
      "anxiously on her husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“After we’d done our work, Fred poured it all out to me. He can’t bear\r\n",
      "to be a clergyman, and Mary says she won’t have him if he is one; and\r\n",
      "the lad would like to be under me and give his mind to business. And\r\n",
      "I’ve determined to take him and make a man of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Caleb!” said Mrs. Garth, in a deep contralto, expressive of resigned\r\n",
      "astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a fine thing to do,” said Mr. Garth, settling himself firmly\r\n",
      "against the back of his chair, and grasping the elbows. “I shall have\r\n",
      "trouble with him, but I think I shall carry it through. The lad loves\r\n",
      "Mary, and a true love for a good woman is a great thing, Susan. It\r\n",
      "shapes many a rough fellow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Has Mary spoken to you on the subject?” said Mrs Garth, secretly a\r\n",
      "little hurt that she had to be informed on it herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not a word. I asked her about Fred once; I gave her a bit of a\r\n",
      "warning. But she assured me she would never marry an idle\r\n",
      "self-indulgent man—nothing since. But it seems Fred set on Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden him to speak\r\n",
      "himself, and Mr. Farebrother has found out that she is fond of Fred,\r\n",
      "but says he must not be a clergyman. Fred’s heart is fixed on Mary,\r\n",
      "that I can see: it gives me a good opinion of the lad—and we always\r\n",
      "liked him, Susan.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a pity for Mary, I think,” said Mrs. Garth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why—a pity?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because, Caleb, she might have had a man who is worth twenty Fred\r\n",
      "Vincy’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah?” said Caleb, with surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I firmly believe that Mr. Farebrother is attached to her, and meant to\r\n",
      "make her an offer; but of course, now that Fred has used him as an\r\n",
      "envoy, there is an end to that better prospect.” There was a severe\r\n",
      "precision in Mrs. Garth’s utterance. She was vexed and disappointed,\r\n",
      "but she was bent on abstaining from useless words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Caleb was silent a few moments under a conflict of feelings. He looked\r\n",
      "at the floor and moved his head and hands in accompaniment to some\r\n",
      "inward argumentation. At last he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That would have made me very proud and happy, Susan, and I should have\r\n",
      "been glad for your sake. I’ve always felt that your belongings have\r\n",
      "never been on a level with you. But you took me, though I was a plain\r\n",
      "man.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I took the best and cleverest man I had ever known,” said Mrs. Garth,\r\n",
      "convinced that _she_ would never have loved any one who came short of\r\n",
      "that mark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, perhaps others thought you might have done better. But it would\r\n",
      "have been worse for me. And that is what touches me close about Fred.\r\n",
      "The lad is good at bottom, and clever enough to do, if he’s put in the\r\n",
      "right way; and he loves and honors my daughter beyond anything, and she\r\n",
      "has given him a sort of promise according to what he turns out. I say,\r\n",
      "that young man’s soul is in my hand; and I’ll do the best I can for\r\n",
      "him, so help me God! It’s my duty, Susan.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth was not given to tears, but there was a large one rolling\r\n",
      "down her face before her husband had finished. It came from the\r\n",
      "pressure of various feelings, in which there was much affection and\r\n",
      "some vexation. She wiped it away quickly, saying—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Few men besides you would think it a duty to add to their anxieties in\r\n",
      "that way, Caleb.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That signifies nothing—what other men would think. I’ve got a clear\r\n",
      "feeling inside me, and that I shall follow; and I hope your heart will\r\n",
      "go with me, Susan, in making everything as light as can be to Mary,\r\n",
      "poor child.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Caleb, leaning back in his chair, looked with anxious appeal towards\r\n",
      "his wife. She rose and kissed him, saying, “God bless you, Caleb! Our\r\n",
      "children have a good father.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she went out and had a hearty cry to make up for the suppression of\r\n",
      "her words. She felt sure that her husband’s conduct would be\r\n",
      "misunderstood, and about Fred she was rational and unhopeful. Which\r\n",
      "would turn out to have the more foresight in it—her rationality or\r\n",
      "Caleb’s ardent generosity?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Fred went to the office the next morning, there was a test to be\r\n",
      "gone through which he was not prepared for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now Fred,” said Caleb, “you will have some desk-work. I have always\r\n",
      "done a good deal of writing myself, but I can’t do without help, and as\r\n",
      "I want you to understand the accounts and get the values into your\r\n",
      "head, I mean to do without another clerk. So you must buckle to. How\r\n",
      "are you at writing and arithmetic?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred felt an awkward movement of the heart; he had not thought of\r\n",
      "desk-work; but he was in a resolute mood, and not going to shrink. “I’m\r\n",
      "not afraid of arithmetic, Mr. Garth: it always came easily to me. I\r\n",
      "think you know my writing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let us see,” said Caleb, taking up a pen, examining it carefully and\r\n",
      "handing it, well dipped, to Fred with a sheet of ruled paper. “Copy me\r\n",
      "a line or two of that valuation, with the figures at the end.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that time the opinion existed that it was beneath a gentleman to\r\n",
      "write legibly, or with a hand in the least suitable to a clerk. Fred\r\n",
      "wrote the lines demanded in a hand as gentlemanly as that of any\r\n",
      "viscount or bishop of the day: the vowels were all alike and the\r\n",
      "consonants only distinguishable as turning up or down, the strokes had\r\n",
      "a blotted solidity and the letters disdained to keep the line—in short,\r\n",
      "it was a manuscript of that venerable kind easy to interpret when you\r\n",
      "know beforehand what the writer means.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Caleb looked on, his visage showed a growing depression, but when\r\n",
      "Fred handed him the paper he gave something like a snarl, and rapped\r\n",
      "the paper passionately with the back of his hand. Bad work like this\r\n",
      "dispelled all Caleb’s mildness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The deuce!” he exclaimed, snarlingly. “To think that this is a country\r\n",
      "where a man’s education may cost hundreds and hundreds, and it turns\r\n",
      "you out this!” Then in a more pathetic tone, pushing up his spectacles\r\n",
      "and looking at the unfortunate scribe, “The Lord have mercy on us,\r\n",
      "Fred, I can’t put up with this!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What can I do, Mr. Garth?” said Fred, whose spirits had sunk very low,\r\n",
      "not only at the estimate of his handwriting, but at the vision of\r\n",
      "himself as liable to be ranked with office clerks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do? Why, you must learn to form your letters and keep the line. What’s\r\n",
      "the use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?” asked Caleb,\r\n",
      "energetically, quite preoccupied with the bad quality of the work. “Is\r\n",
      "there so little business in the world that you must be sending puzzles\r\n",
      "over the country? But that’s the way people are brought up. I should\r\n",
      "lose no end of time with the letters some people send me, if Susan did\r\n",
      "not make them out for me. It’s disgusting.” Here Caleb tossed the paper\r\n",
      "from him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Any stranger peeping into the office at that moment might have wondered\r\n",
      "what was the drama between the indignant man of business, and the\r\n",
      "fine-looking young fellow whose blond complexion was getting rather\r\n",
      "patchy as he bit his lip with mortification. Fred was struggling with\r\n",
      "many thoughts. Mr. Garth had been so kind and encouraging at the\r\n",
      "beginning of their interview, that gratitude and hopefulness had been\r\n",
      "at a high pitch, and the downfall was proportionate. He had not thought\r\n",
      "of desk-work—in fact, like the majority of young gentlemen, he wanted\r\n",
      "an occupation which should be free from disagreeables. I cannot tell\r\n",
      "what might have been the consequences if he had not distinctly promised\r\n",
      "himself that he would go to Lowick to see Mary and tell her that he was\r\n",
      "engaged to work under her father. He did not like to disappoint himself\r\n",
      "there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very sorry,” were all the words that he could muster. But Mr.\r\n",
      "Garth was already relenting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We must make the best of it, Fred,” he began, with a return to his\r\n",
      "usual quiet tone. “Every man can learn to write. I taught myself. Go at\r\n",
      "it with a will, and sit up at night if the day-time isn’t enough. We’ll\r\n",
      "be patient, my boy. Callum shall go on with the books for a bit, while\r\n",
      "you are learning. But now I must be off,” said Caleb, rising. “You must\r\n",
      "let your father know our agreement. You’ll save me Callum’s salary, you\r\n",
      "know, when you can write; and I can afford to give you eighty pounds\r\n",
      "for the first year, and more after.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Fred made the necessary disclosure to his parents, the relative\r\n",
      "effect on the two was a surprise which entered very deeply into his\r\n",
      "memory. He went straight from Mr. Garth’s office to the warehouse,\r\n",
      "rightly feeling that the most respectful way in which he could behave\r\n",
      "to his father was to make the painful communication as gravely and\r\n",
      "formally as possible. Moreover, the decision would be more certainly\r\n",
      "understood to be final, if the interview took place in his father’s\r\n",
      "gravest hours, which were always those spent in his private room at the\r\n",
      "warehouse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred entered on the subject directly, and declared briefly what he had\r\n",
      "done and was resolved to do, expressing at the end his regret that he\r\n",
      "should be the cause of disappointment to his father, and taking the\r\n",
      "blame on his own deficiencies. The regret was genuine, and inspired\r\n",
      "Fred with strong, simple words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy listened in profound surprise without uttering even an\r\n",
      "exclamation, a silence which in his impatient temperament was a sign of\r\n",
      "unusual emotion. He had not been in good spirits about trade that\r\n",
      "morning, and the slight bitterness in his lips grew intense as he\r\n",
      "listened. When Fred had ended, there was a pause of nearly a minute,\r\n",
      "during which Mr. Vincy replaced a book in his desk and turned the key\r\n",
      "emphatically. Then he looked at his son steadily, and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So you’ve made up your mind at last, sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, father.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well; stick to it. I’ve no more to say. You’ve thrown away your\r\n",
      "education, and gone down a step in life, when I had given you the means\r\n",
      "of rising, that’s all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very sorry that we differ, father. I think I can be quite as much\r\n",
      "of a gentleman at the work I have undertaken, as if I had been a\r\n",
      "curate. But I am grateful to you for wishing to do the best for me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well; I have no more to say. I wash my hands of you. I only hope,\r\n",
      "when you have a son of your own he will make a better return for the\r\n",
      "pains you spend on him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was very cutting to Fred. His father was using that unfair\r\n",
      "advantage possessed by us all when we are in a pathetic situation and\r\n",
      "see our own past as if it were simply part of the pathos. In reality,\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy’s wishes about his son had had a great deal of pride,\r\n",
      "inconsiderateness, and egoistic folly in them. But still the\r\n",
      "disappointed father held a strong lever; and Fred felt as if he were\r\n",
      "being banished with a malediction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?” he said,\r\n",
      "after rising to go; “I shall have a sufficient salary to pay for my\r\n",
      "board, as of course I should wish to do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Board be hanged!” said Mr. Vincy, recovering himself in his disgust at\r\n",
      "the notion that Fred’s keep would be missed at his table. “Of course\r\n",
      "your mother will want you to stay. But I shall keep no horse for you,\r\n",
      "you understand; and you will pay your own tailor. You will do with a\r\n",
      "suit or two less, I fancy, when you have to pay for ’em.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred lingered; there was still something to be said. At last it came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope you will shake hands with me, father, and forgive me the\r\n",
      "vexation I have caused you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy from his chair threw a quick glance upward at his son, who\r\n",
      "had advanced near to him, and then gave his hand, saying hurriedly,\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, let us say no more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred went through much more narrative and explanation with his mother,\r\n",
      "but she was inconsolable, having before her eyes what perhaps her\r\n",
      "husband had never thought of, the certainty that Fred would marry Mary\r\n",
      "Garth, that her life would henceforth be spoiled by a perpetual\r\n",
      "infusion of Garths and their ways, and that her darling boy, with his\r\n",
      "beautiful face and stylish air “beyond anybody else’s son in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch,” would be sure to get like that family in plainness of\r\n",
      "appearance and carelessness about his clothes. To her it seemed that\r\n",
      "there was a Garth conspiracy to get possession of the desirable Fred,\r\n",
      "but she dared not enlarge on this opinion, because a slight hint of it\r\n",
      "had made him “fly out” at her as he had never done before. Her temper\r\n",
      "was too sweet for her to show any anger, but she felt that her\r\n",
      "happiness had received a bruise, and for several days merely to look at\r\n",
      "Fred made her cry a little as if he were the subject of some baleful\r\n",
      "prophecy. Perhaps she was the slower to recover her usual cheerfulness\r\n",
      "because Fred had warned her that she must not reopen the sore question\r\n",
      "with his father, who had accepted his decision and forgiven him. If her\r\n",
      "husband had been vehement against Fred, she would have been urged into\r\n",
      "defence of her darling. It was the end of the fourth day when Mr. Vincy\r\n",
      "said to her—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, Lucy, my dear, don’t be so down-hearted. You always have spoiled\r\n",
      "the boy, and you must go on spoiling him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing ever did cut me so before, Vincy,” said the wife, her fair\r\n",
      "throat and chin beginning to tremble again, “only his illness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pooh, pooh, never mind! We must expect to have trouble with our\r\n",
      "children. Don’t make it worse by letting me see you out of spirits.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I won’t,” said Mrs. Vincy, roused by this appeal and adjusting\r\n",
      "herself with a little shake as of a bird which lays down its ruffled\r\n",
      "plumage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It won’t do to begin making a fuss about one,” said Mr. Vincy, wishing\r\n",
      "to combine a little grumbling with domestic cheerfulness. “There’s\r\n",
      "Rosamond as well as Fred.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, poor thing. I’m sure I felt for her being disappointed of her\r\n",
      "baby; but she got over it nicely.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Baby, pooh! I can see Lydgate is making a mess of his practice, and\r\n",
      "getting into debt too, by what I hear. I shall have Rosamond coming to\r\n",
      "me with a pretty tale one of these days. But they’ll get no money from\r\n",
      "me, I know. Let _his_ family help him. I never did like that marriage.\r\n",
      "But it’s no use talking. Ring the bell for lemons, and don’t look dull\r\n",

      "object-lesson given to him by the educational mother. Christy himself,\r\n",
      "a square-browed, broad-shouldered masculine edition of his mother not\r\n",
      "much higher than Fred’s shoulder—which made it the harder that he\r\n",
      "should be held superior—was always as simple as possible, and thought\r\n",
      "no more of Fred’s disinclination to scholarship than of a giraffe’s,\r\n",
      "wishing that he himself were more of the same height. He was lying on\r\n",
      "the ground now by his mother’s chair, with his straw hat laid flat over\r\n",
      "his eyes, while Jim on the other side was reading aloud from that\r\n",
      "beloved writer who has made a chief part in the happiness of many young\r\n",
      "lives. The volume was “Ivanhoe,” and Jim was in the great archery scene\r\n",
      "at the tournament, but suffered much interruption from Ben, who had\r\n",
      "fetched his own old bow and arrows, and was making himself dreadfully\r\n",
      "disagreeable, Letty thought, by begging all present to observe his\r\n",
      "random shots, which no one wished to do except Brownie, the\r\n",
      "active-minded but probably shallow mongrel, while the grizzled\r\n",
      "Newfoundland lying in the sun looked on with the dull-eyed neutrality\r\n",
      "of extreme old age. Letty herself, showing as to her mouth and pinafore\r\n",
      "some slight signs that she had been assisting at the gathering of the\r\n",
      "cherries which stood in a coral-heap on the tea-table, was now seated\r\n",
      "on the grass, listening open-eyed to the reading.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the centre of interest was changed for all by the arrival of Fred\r\n",
      "Vincy. When, seating himself on a garden-stool, he said that he was on\r\n",
      "his way to Lowick Parsonage, Ben, who had thrown down his bow, and\r\n",
      "snatched up a reluctant half-grown kitten instead, strode across Fred’s\r\n",
      "outstretched leg, and said “Take me!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, and me too,” said Letty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can’t keep up with Fred and me,” said Ben.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I can. Mother, please say that I am to go,” urged Letty, whose\r\n",
      "life was much checkered by resistance to her depreciation as a girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall stay with Christy,” observed Jim; as much as to say that he\r\n",
      "had the advantage of those simpletons; whereupon Letty put her hand up\r\n",
      "to her head and looked with jealous indecision from the one to the\r\n",
      "other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let us all go and see Mary,” said Christy, opening his arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, my dear child, we must not go in a swarm to the parsonage. And\r\n",
      "that old Glasgow suit of yours would never do. Besides, your father\r\n",
      "will come home. We must let Fred go alone. He can tell Mary that you\r\n",
      "are here, and she will come back to-morrow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Christy glanced at his own threadbare knees, and then at Fred’s\r\n",
      "beautiful white trousers. Certainly Fred’s tailoring suggested the\r\n",
      "advantages of an English university, and he had a graceful way even of\r\n",
      "looking warm and of pushing his hair back with his handkerchief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Children, run away,” said Mrs. Garth; “it is too warm to hang about\r\n",
      "your friends. Take your brother and show him the rabbits.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The eldest understood, and led off the children immediately. Fred felt\r\n",
      "that Mrs. Garth wished to give him an opportunity of saying anything he\r\n",
      "had to say, but he could only begin by observing—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How glad you must be to have Christy here!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; he has come sooner than I expected. He got down from the coach at\r\n",
      "nine o’clock, just after his father went out. I am longing for Caleb to\r\n",
      "come and hear what wonderful progress Christy is making. He has paid\r\n",
      "his expenses for the last year by giving lessons, carrying on hard\r\n",
      "study at the same time. He hopes soon to get a private tutorship and go\r\n",
      "abroad.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is a great fellow,” said Fred, to whom these cheerful truths had a\r\n",
      "medicinal taste, “and no trouble to anybody.” After a slight pause, he\r\n",
      "added, “But I fear you will think that I am going to be a great deal of\r\n",
      "trouble to Mr. Garth.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Caleb likes taking trouble: he is one of those men who always do more\r\n",
      "than any one would have thought of asking them to do,” answered Mrs.\r\n",
      "Garth. She was knitting, and could either look at Fred or not, as she\r\n",
      "chose—always an advantage when one is bent on loading speech with\r\n",
      "salutary meaning; and though Mrs. Garth intended to be duly reserved,\r\n",
      "she did wish to say something that Fred might be the better for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know you think me very undeserving, Mrs. Garth, and with good\r\n",
      "reason,” said Fred, his spirit rising a little at the perception of\r\n",
      "something like a disposition to lecture him. “I happen to have behaved\r\n",
      "just the worst to the people I can’t help wishing for the most from.\r\n",
      "But while two men like Mr. Garth and Mr. Farebrother have not given me\r\n",
      "up, I don’t see why I should give myself up.” Fred thought it might be\r\n",
      "well to suggest these masculine examples to Mrs. Garth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Assuredly,” said she, with gathering emphasis. “A young man for whom\r\n",
      "two such elders had devoted themselves would indeed be culpable if he\r\n",
      "threw himself away and made their sacrifices vain.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred wondered a little at this strong language, but only said, “I hope\r\n",
      "it will not be so with me, Mrs. Garth, since I have some encouragement\r\n",
      "to believe that I may win Mary. Mr. Garth has told you about that? You\r\n",
      "were not surprised, I dare say?” Fred ended, innocently referring only\r\n",
      "to his own love as probably evident enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not surprised that Mary has given you encouragement?” returned Mrs.\r\n",
      "Garth, who thought it would be well for Fred to be more alive to the\r\n",
      "fact that Mary’s friends could not possibly have wished this\r\n",
      "beforehand, whatever the Vincys might suppose. “Yes, I confess I was\r\n",
      "surprised.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She never did give me any—not the least in the world, when I talked to\r\n",
      "her myself,” said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. “But when I asked Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother to speak for me, she allowed him to tell me there was a\r\n",
      "hope.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The power of admonition which had begun to stir in Mrs. Garth had not\r\n",
      "yet discharged itself. It was a little too provoking even for _her_\r\n",
      "self-control that this blooming youngster should flourish on the\r\n",
      "disappointments of sadder and wiser people—making a meal of a\r\n",
      "nightingale and never knowing it—and that all the while his family\r\n",
      "should suppose that hers was in eager need of this sprig; and her\r\n",
      "vexation had fermented the more actively because of its total\r\n",
      "repression towards her husband. Exemplary wives will sometimes find\r\n",
      "scapegoats in this way. She now said with energetic decision, “You made\r\n",
      "a great mistake, Fred, in asking Mr. Farebrother to speak for you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did I?” said Fred, reddening instantaneously. He was alarmed, but at a\r\n",
      "loss to know what Mrs. Garth meant, and added, in an apologetic tone,\r\n",
      "“Mr. Farebrother has always been such a friend of ours; and Mary, I\r\n",
      "knew, would listen to him gravely; and he took it on himself quite\r\n",
      "readily.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, young people are usually blind to everything but their own\r\n",
      "wishes, and seldom imagine how much those wishes cost others,” said\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth. She did not mean to go beyond this salutary general\r\n",
      "doctrine, and threw her indignation into a needless unwinding of her\r\n",
      "worsted, knitting her brow at it with a grand air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot conceive how it could be any pain to Mr. Farebrother,” said\r\n",
      "Fred, who nevertheless felt that surprising conceptions were beginning\r\n",
      "to form themselves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Precisely; you cannot conceive,” said Mrs. Garth, cutting her words as\r\n",
      "neatly as possible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment Fred looked at the horizon with a dismayed anxiety, and\r\n",
      "then turning with a quick movement said almost sharply—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you mean to say, Mrs. Garth, that Mr. Farebrother is in love with\r\n",
      "Mary?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And if it were so, Fred, I think you are the last person who ought to\r\n",
      "be surprised,” returned Mrs. Garth, laying her knitting down beside her\r\n",
      "and folding her arms. It was an unwonted sign of emotion in her that\r\n",
      "she should put her work out of her hands. In fact her feelings were\r\n",
      "divided between the satisfaction of giving Fred his discipline and the\r\n",
      "sense of having gone a little too far. Fred took his hat and stick and\r\n",
      "rose quickly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you think I am standing in his way, and in Mary’s too?” he said,\r\n",
      "in a tone which seemed to demand an answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth could not speak immediately. She had brought herself into\r\n",
      "the unpleasant position of being called on to say what she really felt,\r\n",
      "yet what she knew there were strong reasons for concealing. And to her\r\n",
      "the consciousness of having exceeded in words was peculiarly\r\n",
      "mortifying. Besides, Fred had given out unexpected electricity, and he\r\n",
      "now added, “Mr. Garth seemed pleased that Mary should be attached to\r\n",
      "me. He could not have known anything of this.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth felt a severe twinge at this mention of her husband, the\r\n",
      "fear that Caleb might think her in the wrong not being easily\r\n",
      "endurable. She answered, wanting to check unintended consequences—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I spoke from inference only. I am not aware that Mary knows anything\r\n",
      "of the matter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she hesitated to beg that he would keep entire silence on a subject\r\n",
      "which she had herself unnecessarily mentioned, not being used to stoop\r\n",
      "in that way; and while she was hesitating there was already a rush of\r\n",
      "unintended consequences under the apple-tree where the tea-things\r\n",
      "stood. Ben, bouncing across the grass with Brownie at his heels, and\r\n",
      "seeing the kitten dragging the knitting by a lengthening line of wool,\r\n",
      "shouted and clapped his hands; Brownie barked, the kitten, desperate,\r\n",
      "jumped on the tea-table and upset the milk, then jumped down again and\r\n",
      "swept half the cherries with it; and Ben, snatching up the half-knitted\r\n",
      "sock-top, fitted it over the kitten’s head as a new source of madness,\r\n",
      "while Letty arriving cried out to her mother against this cruelty—it\r\n",
      "was a history as full of sensation as “This is the house that Jack\r\n",
      "built.” Mrs. Garth was obliged to interfere, the other young ones came\r\n",
      "up and the _tête-à-tête_ with Fred was ended. He got away as soon as he\r\n",
      "could, and Mrs. Garth could only imply some retractation of her\r\n",
      "severity by saying “God bless you” when she shook hands with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was unpleasantly conscious that she had been on the verge of\r\n",
      "speaking as “one of the foolish women speaketh”—telling first and\r\n",
      "entreating silence after. But she had not entreated silence, and to\r\n",
      "prevent Caleb’s blame she determined to blame herself and confess all\r\n",
      "to him that very night. It was curious what an awful tribunal the mild\r\n",
      "Caleb’s was to her, whenever he set it up. But she meant to point out\r\n",
      "to him that the revelation might do Fred Vincy a great deal of good.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No doubt it was having a strong effect on him as he walked to Lowick.\r\n",
      "Fred’s light hopeful nature had perhaps never had so much of a bruise\r\n",
      "as from this suggestion that if he had been out of the way Mary might\r\n",
      "have made a thoroughly good match. Also he was piqued that he had been\r\n",
      "what he called such a stupid lout as to ask that intervention from Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother. But it was not in a lover’s nature—it was not in Fred’s,\r\n",
      "that the new anxiety raised about Mary’s feeling should not surmount\r\n",
      "every other. Notwithstanding his trust in Mr. Farebrother’s generosity,\r\n",
      "notwithstanding what Mary had said to him, Fred could not help feeling\r\n",
      "that he had a rival: it was a new consciousness, and he objected to it\r\n",
      "extremely, not being in the least ready to give up Mary for her good,\r\n",
      "being ready rather to fight for her with any man whatsoever. But the\r\n",
      "fighting with Mr. Farebrother must be of a metaphorical kind, which was\r\n",
      "much more difficult to Fred than the muscular. Certainly this\r\n",
      "experience was a discipline for Fred hardly less sharp than his\r\n",
      "disappointment about his uncle’s will. The iron had not entered into\r\n",
      "his soul, but he had begun to imagine what the sharp edge would be. It\r\n",
      "did not once occur to Fred that Mrs. Garth might be mistaken about Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother, but he suspected that she might be wrong about Mary. Mary\r\n",
      "had been staying at the parsonage lately, and her mother might know\r\n",
      "very little of what had been passing in her mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not feel easier when he found her looking cheerful with the\r\n",
      "three ladies in the drawing-room. They were in animated discussion on\r\n",
      "some subject which was dropped when he entered, and Mary was copying\r\n",
      "the labels from a heap of shallow cabinet drawers, in a minute\r\n",
      "handwriting which she was skilled in. Mr. Farebrother was somewhere in\r\n",
      "the village, and the three ladies knew nothing of Fred’s peculiar\r\n",
      "relation to Mary: it was impossible for either of them to propose that\r\n",
      "they should walk round the garden, and Fred predicted to himself that\r\n",
      "he should have to go away without saying a word to her in private. He\r\n",
      "told her first of Christy’s arrival and then of his own engagement with\r\n",
      "her father; and he was comforted by seeing that this latter news\r\n",
      "touched her keenly. She said hurriedly, “I am so glad,” and then bent\r\n",
      "over her writing to hinder any one from noticing her face. But here was\r\n",
      "a subject which Mrs. Farebrother could not let pass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t mean, my dear Miss Garth, that you are glad to hear of a\r\n",
      "young man giving up the Church for which he was educated: you only mean\r\n",
      "that things being so, you are glad that he should be under an excellent\r\n",
      "man like your father.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, really, Mrs. Farebrother, I am glad of both, I fear,” said Mary,\r\n",
      "cleverly getting rid of one rebellious tear. “I have a dreadfully\r\n",
      "secular mind. I never liked any clergyman except the Vicar of Wakefield\r\n",
      "and Mr. Farebrother.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now why, my dear?” said Mrs. Farebrother, pausing on her large wooden\r\n",
      "knitting-needles and looking at Mary. “You have always a good reason\r\n",
      "for your opinions, but this astonishes me. Of course I put out of the\r\n",
      "question those who preach new doctrine. But why should you dislike\r\n",
      "clergymen?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh dear,” said Mary, her face breaking into merriment as she seemed to\r\n",
      "consider a moment, “I don’t like their neckcloths.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, you don’t like Camden’s, then,” said Miss Winifred, in some\r\n",
      "anxiety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I do,” said Mary. “I don’t like the other clergymen’s neckcloths,\r\n",
      "because it is they who wear them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How very puzzling!” said Miss Noble, feeling that her own intellect\r\n",
      "was probably deficient.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear, you are joking. You would have better reasons than these for\r\n",
      "slighting so respectable a class of men,” said Mrs. Farebrother,\r\n",
      "majestically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Garth has such severe notions of what people should be that it is\r\n",
      "difficult to satisfy her,” said Fred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I am glad at least that she makes an exception in favor of my\r\n",
      "son,” said the old lady.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary was wondering at Fred’s piqued tone, when Mr. Farebrother came in\r\n",
      "and had to hear the news about the engagement under Mr. Garth. At the\r\n",
      "end he said with quiet satisfaction, “_That_ is right;” and then bent\r\n",
      "to look at Mary’s labels and praise her handwriting. Fred felt horribly\r\n",
      "jealous—was glad, of course, that Mr. Farebrother was so estimable, but\r\n",
      "wished that he had been ugly and fat as men at forty sometimes are. It\r\n",
      "was clear what the end would be, since Mary openly placed Farebrother\r\n",
      "above everybody, and these women were all evidently encouraging the\r\n",
      "affair. He was feeling sure that he should have no chance of speaking\r\n",
      "to Mary, when Mr. Farebrother said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fred, help me to carry these drawers back into my study—you have never\r\n",
      "seen my fine new study. Pray come too, Miss Garth. I want you to see a\r\n",
      "stupendous spider I found this morning.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary at once saw the Vicar’s intention. He had never since the\r\n",
      "memorable evening deviated from his old pastoral kindness towards her,\r\n",
      "and her momentary wonder and doubt had quite gone to sleep. Mary was\r\n",
      "accustomed to think rather rigorously of what was probable, and if a\r\n",
      "belief flattered her vanity she felt warned to dismiss it as\r\n",
      "ridiculous, having early had much exercise in such dismissals. It was\r\n",
      "as she had foreseen: when Fred had been asked to admire the fittings of\r\n",
      "the study, and she had been asked to admire the spider, Mr. Farebrother\r\n",
      "said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Wait here a minute or two. I am going to look out an engraving which\r\n",
      "Fred is tall enough to hang for me. I shall be back in a few minutes.”\r\n",
      "And then he went out. Nevertheless, the first word Fred said to Mary\r\n",
      "was—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is of no use, whatever I do, Mary. You are sure to marry\r\n",
      "Farebrother at last.” There was some rage in his tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you mean, Fred?” Mary exclaimed indignantly, blushing deeply,\r\n",
      "and surprised out of all her readiness in reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is impossible that you should not see it all clearly enough—you who\r\n",
      "see everything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I only see that you are behaving very ill, Fred, in speaking so of Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother after he has pleaded your cause in every way. How can you\r\n",
      "have taken up such an idea?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred was rather deep, in spite of his irritation. If Mary had really\r\n",
      "been unsuspicious, there was no good in telling her what Mrs. Garth had\r\n",
      "said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It follows as a matter of course,” he replied. “When you are\r\n",
      "continually seeing a man who beats me in everything, and whom you set\r\n",
      "up above everybody, I can have no fair chance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are very ungrateful, Fred,” said Mary. “I wish I had never told\r\n",
      "Mr. Farebrother that I cared for you in the least.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I am not ungrateful; I should be the happiest fellow in the world\r\n",
      "if it were not for this. I told your father everything, and he was very\r\n",
      "kind; he treated me as if I were his son. I could go at the work with a\r\n",
      "will, writing and everything, if it were not for this.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For this? for what?” said Mary, imagining now that something specific\r\n",
      "must have been said or done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This dreadful certainty that I shall be bowled out by Farebrother.”\r\n",

      "exactly tender, and certainly not merry. Rosamond was silent and did\r\n",

      "enough without smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Those words of Lydgate’s were like a sad milestone marking how far he\r\n",

      "mind after the fashion of an accomplished mermaid, using her comb and\r\n",
      "looking-glass and singing her song for the relaxation of his adored\r\n",
      "wisdom alone. He had begun to distinguish between that imagined\r\n",
      "adoration and the attraction towards a man’s talent because it gives\r\n",
      "him prestige, and is like an order in his button-hole or an Honorable\r\n",
      "before his name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It might have been supposed that Rosamond had travelled too, since she\r\n",
      "had found the pointless conversation of Mr. Ned Plymdale perfectly\r\n",
      "wearisome; but to most mortals there is a stupidity which is\r\n",
      "unendurable and a stupidity which is altogether acceptable—else,\r\n",
      "indeed, what would become of social bonds? Captain Lydgate’s stupidity\r\n",
      "was delicately scented, carried itself with “style,” talked with a good\r\n",
      "accent, and was closely related to Sir Godwin. Rosamond found it quite\r\n",
      "agreeable and caught many of its phrases.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Therefore since Rosamond, as we know, was fond of horseback, there were\r\n",
      "plenty of reasons why she should be tempted to resume her riding when\r\n",
      "Captain Lydgate, who had ordered his man with two horses to follow him\r\n",
      "and put up at the “Green Dragon,” begged her to go out on the gray\r\n",
      "which he warranted to be gentle and trained to carry a lady—indeed, he\r\n",
      "had bought it for his sister, and was taking it to Quallingham.\r\n",
      "Rosamond went out the first time without telling her husband, and came\r\n",
      "back before his return; but the ride had been so thorough a success,\r\n",
      "and she declared herself so much the better in consequence, that he was\r\n",
      "informed of it with full reliance on his consent that she should go\r\n",
      "riding again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the contrary Lydgate was more than hurt—he was utterly confounded\r\n",
      "that she had risked herself on a strange horse without referring the\r\n",
      "matter to his wish. After the first almost thundering exclamations of\r\n",
      "astonishment, which sufficiently warned Rosamond of what was coming, he\r\n",
      "was silent for some moments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“However, you have come back safely,” he said, at last, in a decisive\r\n",
      "tone. “You will not go again, Rosy; that is understood. If it were the\r\n",
      "quietest, most familiar horse in the world, there would always be the\r\n",
      "chance of accident. And you know very well that I wished you to give up\r\n",
      "riding the roan on that account.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But there is the chance of accident indoors, Tertius.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My darling, don’t talk nonsense,” said Lydgate, in an imploring tone;\r\n",
      "“surely I am the person to judge for you. I think it is enough that I\r\n",
      "say you are not to go again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond was arranging her hair before dinner, and the reflection of\r\n",
      "her head in the glass showed no change in its loveliness except a\r\n",
      "little turning aside of the long neck. Lydgate had been moving about\r\n",
      "with his hands in his pockets, and now paused near her, as if he\r\n",
      "awaited some assurance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish you would fasten up my plaits, dear,” said Rosamond, letting\r\n",
      "her arms fall with a little sigh, so as to make a husband ashamed of\r\n",
      "standing there like a brute. Lydgate had often fastened the plaits\r\n",
      "before, being among the deftest of men with his large finely formed\r\n",
      "fingers. He swept up the soft festoons of plaits and fastened in the\r\n",
      "tall comb (to such uses do men come!); and what could he do then but\r\n",
      "kiss the exquisite nape which was shown in all its delicate curves? But\r\n",
      "when we do what we have done before, it is often with a difference.\r\n",
      "Lydgate was still angry, and had not forgotten his point.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall tell the Captain that he ought to have known better than offer\r\n",
      "you his horse,” he said, as he moved away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I beg you will not do anything of the kind, Tertius,” said Rosamond,\r\n",
      "looking at him with something more marked than usual in her speech. “It\r\n",
      "will be treating me as if I were a child. Promise that you will leave\r\n",
      "the subject to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There did seem to be some truth in her objection. Lydgate said, “Very\r\n",
      "well,” with a surly obedience, and thus the discussion ended with his\r\n",
      "promising Rosamond, and not with her promising him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In fact, she had been determined not to promise. Rosamond had that\r\n",
      "victorious obstinacy which never wastes its energy in impetuous\r\n",
      "resistance. What she liked to do was to her the right thing, and all\r\n",
      "her cleverness was directed to getting the means of doing it. She meant\r\n",
      "to go out riding again on the gray, and she did go on the next\r\n",
      "opportunity of her husband’s absence, not intending that he should know\r\n",
      "until it was late enough not to signify to her. The temptation was\r\n",
      "certainly great: she was very fond of the exercise, and the\r\n",
      "gratification of riding on a fine horse, with Captain Lydgate, Sir\r\n",
      "Godwin’s son, on another fine horse by her side, and of being met in\r\n",
      "this position by any one but her husband, was something as good as her\r\n",
      "dreams before marriage: moreover she was riveting the connection with\r\n",
      "the family at Quallingham, which must be a wise thing to do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the gentle gray, unprepared for the crash of a tree that was being\r\n",
      "felled on the edge of Halsell wood, took fright, and caused a worse\r\n",
      "fright to Rosamond, leading finally to the loss of her baby. Lydgate\r\n",
      "could not show his anger towards her, but he was rather bearish to the\r\n",
      "Captain, whose visit naturally soon came to an end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In all future conversations on the subject, Rosamond was mildly certain\r\n",
      "that the ride had made no difference, and that if she had stayed at\r\n",
      "home the same symptoms would have come on and would have ended in the\r\n",
      "same way, because she had felt something like them before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate could only say, “Poor, poor darling!”—but he secretly wondered\r\n",
      "over the terrible tenacity of this mild creature. There was gathering\r\n",
      "within him an amazed sense of his powerlessness over Rosamond. His\r\n",
      "superior knowledge and mental force, instead of being, as he had\r\n",
      "imagined, a shrine to consult on all occasions, was simply set aside on\r\n",
      "every practical question. He had regarded Rosamond’s cleverness as\r\n",
      "precisely of the receptive kind which became a woman. He was now\r\n",
      "beginning to find out what that cleverness was—what was the shape into\r\n",
      "which it had run as into a close network aloof and independent. No one\r\n",
      "quicker than Rosamond to see causes and effects which lay within the\r\n",
      "track of her own tastes and interests: she had seen clearly Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "preeminence in Middlemarch society, and could go on imaginatively\r\n",
      "tracing still more agreeable social effects when his talent should have\r\n",
      "advanced him; but for her, his professional and scientific ambition had\r\n",
      "no other relation to these desirable effects than if they had been the\r\n",
      "fortunate discovery of an ill-smelling oil. And that oil apart, with\r\n",
      "which she had nothing to do, of course she believed in her own opinion\r\n",
      "more than she did in his. Lydgate was astounded to find in numberless\r\n",
      "trifling matters, as well as in this last serious case of the riding,\r\n",
      "that affection did not make her compliant. He had no doubt that the\r\n",
      "affection was there, and had no presentiment that he had done anything\r\n",
      "to repel it. For his own part he said to himself that he loved her as\r\n",
      "tenderly as ever, and could make up his mind to her negations;\r\n",
      "but—well! Lydgate was much worried, and conscious of new elements in\r\n",
      "his life as noxious to him as an inlet of mud to a creature that has\r\n",
      "been used to breathe and bathe and dart after its illuminated prey in\r\n",
      "the clearest of waters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond was soon looking lovelier than ever at her worktable, enjoying\r\n",
      "drives in her father’s phaeton and thinking it likely that she might be\r\n",
      "invited to Quallingham. She knew that she was a much more exquisite\r\n",
      "ornament to the drawing-room there than any daughter of the family, and\r\n",
      "in reflecting that the gentlemen were aware of that, did not perhaps\r\n",
      "sufficiently consider whether the ladies would be eager to see\r\n",
      "themselves surpassed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate, relieved from anxiety about her, relapsed into what she\r\n",
      "inwardly called his moodiness—a name which to her covered his\r\n",
      "thoughtful preoccupation with other subjects than herself, as well as\r\n",
      "that uneasy look of the brow and distaste for all ordinary things as if\r\n",
      "they were mixed with bitter herbs, which really made a sort of\r\n",
      "weather-glass to his vexation and foreboding. These latter states of\r\n",
      "mind had one cause amongst others, which he had generously but\r\n",
      "mistakenly avoided mentioning to Rosamond, lest it should affect her\r\n",
      "health and spirits. Between him and her indeed there was that total\r\n",
      "missing of each other’s mental track, which is too evidently possible\r\n",
      "even between persons who are continually thinking of each other. To\r\n",
      "Lydgate it seemed that he had been spending month after month in\r\n",
      "sacrificing more than half of his best intent and best power to his\r\n",
      "tenderness for Rosamond; bearing her little claims and interruptions\r\n",
      "without impatience, and, above all, bearing without betrayal of\r\n",
      "bitterness to look through less and less of interfering illusion at the\r\n",
      "blank unreflecting surface her mind presented to his ardor for the more\r\n",
      "impersonal ends of his profession and his scientific study, an ardor\r\n",
      "which he had fancied that the ideal wife must somehow worship as\r\n",
      "sublime, though not in the least knowing why. But his endurance was\r\n",
      "mingled with a self-discontent which, if we know how to be candid, we\r\n",
      "shall confess to make more than half our bitterness under grievances,\r\n",
      "wife or husband included. It always remains true that if we had been\r\n",
      "greater, circumstance would have been less strong against us. Lydgate\r\n",
      "was aware that his concessions to Rosamond were often little more than\r\n",
      "the lapse of slackening resolution, the creeping paralysis apt to seize\r\n",
      "an enthusiasm which is out of adjustment to a constant portion of our\r\n",
      "lives. And on Lydgate’s enthusiasm there was constantly pressing not a\r\n",
      "simple weight of sorrow, but the biting presence of a petty degrading\r\n",
      "care, such as casts the blight of irony over all higher effort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the care which he had hitherto abstained from mentioning to\r\n",
      "Rosamond; and he believed, with some wonder, that it had never entered\r\n",
      "her mind, though certainly no difficulty could be less mysterious. It\r\n",
      "was an inference with a conspicuous handle to it, and had been easily\r\n",
      "drawn by indifferent observers, that Lydgate was in debt; and he could\r\n",
      "not succeed in keeping out of his mind for long together that he was\r\n",
      "every day getting deeper into that swamp, which tempts men towards it\r\n",
      "with such a pretty covering of flowers and verdure. It is wonderful how\r\n",
      "soon a man gets up to his chin there—in a condition in which, in spite\r\n",
      "of himself, he is forced to think chiefly of release, though he had a\r\n",
      "scheme of the universe in his soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Eighteen months ago Lydgate was poor, but had never known the eager\r\n",
      "want of small sums, and felt rather a burning contempt for any one who\r\n",
      "descended a step in order to gain them. He was now experiencing\r\n",
      "something worse than a simple deficit: he was assailed by the vulgar\r\n",
      "hateful trials of a man who has bought and used a great many things\r\n",
      "which might have been done without, and which he is unable to pay for,\r\n",
      "though the demand for payment has become pressing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How this came about may be easily seen without much arithmetic or\r\n",
      "knowledge of prices. When a man in setting up a house and preparing for\r\n",
      "marriage finds that his furniture and other initial expenses come to\r\n",
      "between four and five hundred pounds more than he has capital to pay\r\n",
      "for; when at the end of a year it appears that his household expenses,\r\n",
      "horses and et caeteras, amount to nearly a thousand, while the proceeds\r\n",
      "of the practice reckoned from the old books to be worth eight hundred\r\n",
      "per annum have sunk like a summer pond and make hardly five hundred,\r\n",
      "chiefly in unpaid entries, the plain inference is that, whether he\r\n",
      "minds it or not, he is in debt. Those were less expensive times than\r\n",
      "our own, and provincial life was comparatively modest; but the ease\r\n",
      "with which a medical man who had lately bought a practice, who thought\r\n",
      "that he was obliged to keep two horses, whose table was supplied\r\n",
      "without stint, and who paid an insurance on his life and a high rent\r\n",
      "for house and garden, might find his expenses doubling his receipts,\r\n",
      "can be conceived by any one who does not think these details beneath\r\n",
      "his consideration. Rosamond, accustomed from her childhood to an\r\n",
      "extravagant household, thought that good housekeeping consisted simply\r\n",
      "in ordering the best of everything—nothing else “answered;” and Lydgate\r\n",
      "supposed that “if things were done at all, they must be done\r\n",
      "properly”—he did not see how they were to live otherwise. If each head\r\n",
      "of household expenditure had been mentioned to him beforehand, he would\r\n",
      "have probably observed that “it could hardly come to much,” and if any\r\n",
      "one had suggested a saving on a particular article—for example, the\r\n",
      "substitution of cheap fish for dear—it would have appeared to him\r\n",
      "simply a penny-wise, mean notion. Rosamond, even without such an\r\n",
      "occasion as Captain Lydgate’s visit, was fond of giving invitations,\r\n",
      "and Lydgate, though he often thought the guests tiresome, did not\r\n",
      "interfere. This sociability seemed a necessary part of professional\r\n",
      "prudence, and the entertainment must be suitable. It is true Lydgate\r\n",
      "was constantly visiting the homes of the poor and adjusting his\r\n",
      "prescriptions of diet to their small means; but, dear me! has it not by\r\n",
      "this time ceased to be remarkable—is it not rather that we expect in\r\n",
      "men, that they should have numerous strands of experience lying side by\r\n",
      "side and never compare them with each other? Expenditure—like ugliness\r\n",
      "and errors—becomes a totally new thing when we attach our own\r\n",
      "personality to it, and measure it by that wide difference which is\r\n",
      "manifest (in our own sensations) between ourselves and others. Lydgate\r\n",
      "believed himself to be careless about his dress, and he despised a man\r\n",
      "who calculated the effects of his costume; it seemed to him only a\r\n",
      "matter of course that he had abundance of fresh garments—such things\r\n",
      "were naturally ordered in sheaves. It must be remembered that he had\r\n",
      "never hitherto felt the check of importunate debt, and he walked by\r\n",
      "habit, not by self-criticism. But the check had come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Its novelty made it the more irritating. He was amazed, disgusted that\r\n",
      "conditions so foreign to all his purposes, so hatefully disconnected\r\n",
      "with the objects he cared to occupy himself with, should have lain in\r\n",
      "ambush and clutched him when he was unaware. And there was not only the\r\n",
      "actual debt; there was the certainty that in his present position he\r\n",
      "must go on deepening it. Two furnishing tradesmen at Brassing, whose\r\n",
      "bills had been incurred before his marriage, and whom uncalculated\r\n",
      "current expenses had ever since prevented him from paying, had\r\n",
      "repeatedly sent him unpleasant letters which had forced themselves on\r\n",
      "his attention. This could hardly have been more galling to any\r\n",
      "disposition than to Lydgate’s, with his intense pride—his dislike of\r\n",
      "asking a favor or being under an obligation to any one. He had scorned\r\n",
      "even to form conjectures about Mr. Vincy’s intentions on money matters,\r\n",
      "and nothing but extremity could have induced him to apply to his\r\n",
      "father-in-law, even if he had not been made aware in various indirect\r\n",
      "ways since his marriage that Mr. Vincy’s own affairs were not\r\n",
      "flourishing, and that the expectation of help from him would be\r\n",
      "resented. Some men easily trust in the readiness of friends; it had\r\n",
      "never in the former part of his life occurred to Lydgate that he should\r\n",
      "need to do so: he had never thought what borrowing would be to him; but\r\n",
      "now that the idea had entered his mind, he felt that he would rather\r\n",
      "incur any other hardship. In the mean time he had no money or prospects\r\n",
      "of money; and his practice was not getting more lucrative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No wonder that Lydgate had been unable to suppress all signs of inward\r\n",
      "trouble during the last few months, and now that Rosamond was regaining\r\n",
      "brilliant health, he meditated taking her entirely into confidence on\r\n",
      "his difficulties. New conversance with tradesmen’s bills had forced his\r\n",
      "reasoning into a new channel of comparison: he had begun to consider\r\n",
      "from a new point of view what was necessary and unnecessary in goods\r\n",
      "ordered, and to see that there must be some change of habits. How could\r\n",
      "such a change be made without Rosamond’s concurrence? The immediate\r\n",
      "occasion of opening the disagreeable fact to her was forced upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having no money, and having privately sought advice as to what security\r\n",
      "could possibly be given by a man in his position, Lydgate had offered\r\n",
      "the one good security in his power to the less peremptory creditor, who\r\n",
      "was a silversmith and jeweller, and who consented to take on himself\r\n",
      "the upholsterer’s credit also, accepting interest for a given term. The\r\n",
      "security necessary was a bill of sale on the furniture of his house,\r\n",
      "which might make a creditor easy for a reasonable time about a debt\r\n",
      "amounting to less than four hundred pounds; and the silversmith, Mr.\r\n",
      "Dover, was willing to reduce it by taking back a portion of the plate\r\n",
      "and any other article which was as good as new. “Any other article” was\r\n",
      "a phrase delicately implying jewellery, and more particularly some\r\n",
      "purple amethysts costing thirty pounds, which Lydgate had bought as a\r\n",
      "bridal present.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Opinions may be divided as to his wisdom in making this present: some\r\n",
      "may think that it was a graceful attention to be expected from a man\r\n",
      "like Lydgate, and that the fault of any troublesome consequences lay in\r\n",
      "the pinched narrowness of provincial life at that time, which offered\r\n",
      "no conveniences for professional people whose fortune was not\r\n",
      "proportioned to their tastes; also, in Lydgate’s ridiculous\r\n",
      "fastidiousness about asking his friends for money.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, it had seemed a question of no moment to him on that fine\r\n",
      "morning when he went to give a final order for plate: in the presence\r\n",
      "of other jewels enormously expensive, and as an addition to orders of\r\n",
      "which the amount had not been exactly calculated, thirty pounds for\r\n",
      "ornaments so exquisitely suited to Rosamond’s neck and arms could\r\n",
      "hardly appear excessive when there was no ready cash for it to exceed.\r\n",
      "But at this crisis Lydgate’s imagination could not help dwelling on the\r\n",
      "possibility of letting the amethysts take their place again among Mr.\r\n",
      "Dover’s stock, though he shrank from the idea of proposing this to\r\n",
      "Rosamond. Having been roused to discern consequences which he had never\r\n",
      "been in the habit of tracing, he was preparing to act on this\r\n",
      "discernment with some of the rigor (by no means all) that he would have\r\n",
      "applied in pursuing experiment. He was nerving himself to this rigor as\r\n",
      "he rode from Brassing, and meditated on the representations he must\r\n",
      "make to Rosamond.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was evening when he got home. He was intensely miserable, this\r\n",
      "strong man of nine-and-twenty and of many gifts. He was not saying\r\n",
      "angrily within himself that he had made a profound mistake; but the\r\n",
      "mistake was at work in him like a recognized chronic disease, mingling\r\n",
      "its uneasy importunities with every prospect, and enfeebling every\r\n",
      "thought. As he went along the passage to the drawing-room, he heard the\r\n",
      "piano and singing. Of course, Ladislaw was there. It was some weeks\r\n",
      "since Will had parted from Dorothea, yet he was still at the old post\r\n",
      "in Middlemarch. Lydgate had no objection in general to Ladislaw’s\r\n",
      "coming, but just now he was annoyed that he could not find his hearth\r\n",
      "free. When he opened the door the two singers went on towards the\r\n",
      "key-note, raising their eyes and looking at him indeed, but not\r\n",
      "regarding his entrance as an interruption. To a man galled with his\r\n",
      "harness as poor Lydgate was, it is not soothing to see two people\r\n",
      "warbling at him, as he comes in with the sense that the painful day has\r\n",
      "still pains in store. His face, already paler than usual, took on a\r\n",
      "scowl as he walked across the room and flung himself into a chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The singers feeling themselves excused by the fact that they had only\r\n",
      "three bars to sing, now turned round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How are you, Lydgate?” said Will, coming forward to shake hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate took his hand, but did not think it necessary to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you dined, Tertius? I expected you much earlier,” said Rosamond,\r\n",
      "who had already seen that her husband was in a “horrible humor.” She\r\n",
      "seated herself in her usual place as she spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have dined. I should like some tea, please,” said Lydgate, curtly,\r\n",
      "still scowling and looking markedly at his legs stretched out before\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was too quick to need more. “I shall be off,” he said, reaching\r\n",
      "his hat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tea is coming,” said Rosamond; “pray don’t go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Lydgate is bored,” said Will, who had more comprehension of\r\n",
      "Lydgate than Rosamond had, and was not offended by his manner, easily\r\n",
      "imagining outdoor causes of annoyance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is the more need for you to stay,” said Rosamond, playfully, and\r\n",
      "in her lightest accent; “he will not speak to me all the evening.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Rosamond, I shall,” said Lydgate, in his strong baritone. “I have\r\n",
      "some serious business to speak to you about.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No introduction of the business could have been less like that which\r\n",
      "Lydgate had intended; but her indifferent manner had been too\r\n",
      "provoking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There! you see,” said Will. “I’m going to the meeting about the\r\n",
      "Mechanics’ Institute. Good-by;” and he went quickly out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond did not look at her husband, but presently rose and took her\r\n",
      "place before the tea-tray. She was thinking that she had never seen him\r\n",
      "so disagreeable. Lydgate turned his dark eyes on her and watched her as\r\n",
      "she delicately handled the tea-service with her taper fingers, and\r\n",
      "looked at the objects immediately before her with no curve in her face\r\n",
      "disturbed, and yet with an ineffable protest in her air against all\r\n",
      "people with unpleasant manners. For the moment he lost the sense of his\r\n",
      "wound in a sudden speculation about this new form of feminine\r\n",
      "impassibility revealing itself in the sylph-like frame which he had\r\n",
      "once interpreted as the sign of a ready intelligent sensitiveness. His\r\n",
      "mind glancing back to Laure while he looked at Rosamond, he said\r\n",
      "inwardly, “Would _she_ kill me because I wearied her?” and then, “It is\r\n",
      "the way with all women.” But this power of generalizing which gives men\r\n",
      "so much the superiority in mistake over the dumb animals, was\r\n",
      "immediately thwarted by Lydgate’s memory of wondering impressions from\r\n",
      "the behavior of another woman—from Dorothea’s looks and tones of\r\n",
      "emotion about her husband when Lydgate began to attend him—from her\r\n",
      "passionate cry to be taught what would best comfort that man for whose\r\n",
      "sake it seemed as if she must quell every impulse in her except the\r\n",
      "yearnings of faithfulness and compassion. These revived impressions\r\n",
      "succeeded each other quickly and dreamily in Lydgate’s mind while the\r\n",
      "tea was being brewed. He had shut his eyes in the last instant of\r\n",
      "reverie while he heard Dorothea saying, “Advise me—think what I can\r\n",
      "do—he has been all his life laboring and looking forward. He minds\r\n",
      "about nothing else—and I mind about nothing else.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That voice of deep-souled womanhood had remained within him as the\r\n",
      "enkindling conceptions of dead and sceptred genius had remained within\r\n",
      "him (is there not a genius for feeling nobly which also reigns over\r\n",
      "human spirits and their conclusions?); the tones were a music from\r\n",
      "which he was falling away—he had really fallen into a momentary doze,\r\n",
      "when Rosamond said in her silvery neutral way, “Here is your tea,\r\n",
      "Tertius,” setting it on the small table by his side, and then moved\r\n",
      "back to her place without looking at him. Lydgate was too hasty in\r\n",
      "attributing insensibility to her; after her own fashion, she was\r\n",
      "sensitive enough, and took lasting impressions. Her impression now was\r\n",
      "one of offence and repulsion. But then, Rosamond had no scowls and had\r\n",
      "never raised her voice: she was quite sure that no one could justly\r\n",
      "find fault with her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps Lydgate and she had never felt so far off each other before;\r\n",
      "but there were strong reasons for not deferring his revelation, even if\r\n",
      "he had not already begun it by that abrupt announcement; indeed some of\r\n",
      "the angry desire to rouse her into more sensibility on his account\r\n",
      "which had prompted him to speak prematurely, still mingled with his\r\n",
      "pain in the prospect of her pain. But he waited till the tray was gone,\r\n",
      "the candles were lit, and the evening quiet might be counted on: the\r\n",
      "interval had left time for repelled tenderness to return into the old\r\n",
      "course. He spoke kindly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear Rosy, lay down your work and come to sit by me,” he said, gently,\r\n",
      "pushing away the table, and stretching out his arm to draw a chair near\r\n",
      "his own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond obeyed. As she came towards him in her drapery of transparent\r\n",
      "faintly tinted muslin, her slim yet round figure never looked more\r\n",
      "graceful; as she sat down by him and laid one hand on the elbow of his\r\n",
      "chair, at last looking at him and meeting his eyes, her delicate neck\r\n",
      "and cheek and purely cut lips never had more of that untarnished beauty\r\n",
      "which touches as in spring-time and infancy and all sweet freshness. It\r\n",
      "touched Lydgate now, and mingled the early moments of his love for her\r\n",
      "with all the other memories which were stirred in this crisis of deep\r\n",
      "trouble. He laid his ample hand softly on hers, saying—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear!” with the lingering utterance which affection gives to the word.\r\n",
      "Rosamond too was still under the power of that same past, and her\r\n",
      "husband was still in part the Lydgate whose approval had stirred\r\n",
      "delight. She put his hair lightly away from his forehead, then laid her\r\n",
      "other hand on his, and was conscious of forgiving him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am obliged to tell you what will hurt you, Rosy. But there are\r\n",
      "things which husband and wife must think of together. I dare say it has\r\n",
      "occurred to you already that I am short of money.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate paused; but Rosamond turned her neck and looked at a vase on\r\n",
      "the mantel-piece.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was not able to pay for all the things we had to get before we were\r\n",
      "married, and there have been expenses since which I have been obliged\r\n",
      "to meet. The consequence is, there is a large debt at Brassing—three\r\n",
      "hundred and eighty pounds—which has been pressing on me a good while,\r\n",
      "and in fact we are getting deeper every day, for people don’t pay me\r\n",
      "the faster because others want the money. I took pains to keep it from\r\n",
      "you while you were not well; but now we must think together about it,\r\n",
      "and you must help me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What can _I_ do, Tertius?” said Rosamond, turning her eyes on him\r\n",
      "again. That little speech of four words, like so many others in all\r\n",
      "languages, is capable by varied vocal inflections of expressing all\r\n",
      "states of mind from helpless dimness to exhaustive argumentative\r\n",
      "perception, from the completest self-devoting fellowship to the most\r\n",
      "neutral aloofness. Rosamond’s thin utterance threw into the words “What\r\n",
      "can—I—do!” as much neutrality as they could hold. They fell like a\r\n",
      "mortal chill on Lydgate’s roused tenderness. He did not storm in\r\n",
      "indignation—he felt too sad a sinking of the heart. And when he spoke\r\n",
      "again it was more in the tone of a man who forces himself to fulfil a\r\n",
      "task.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is necessary for you to know, because I have to give security for a\r\n",
      "time, and a man must come to make an inventory of the furniture.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond colored deeply. “Have you not asked papa for money?” she said,\r\n",
      "as soon as she could speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then I must ask him!” she said, releasing her hands from Lydgate’s,\r\n",
      "and rising to stand at two yards’ distance from him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Rosy,” said Lydgate, decisively. “It is too late to do that. The\r\n",
      "inventory will be begun to-morrow. Remember it is a mere security: it\r\n",
      "will make no difference: it is a temporary affair. I insist upon it\r\n",
      "that your father shall not know, unless I choose to tell him,” added\r\n",
      "Lydgate, with a more peremptory emphasis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This certainly was unkind, but Rosamond had thrown him back on evil\r\n",
      "expectation as to what she would do in the way of quiet steady\r\n",
      "disobedience. The unkindness seemed unpardonable to her: she was not\r\n",
      "given to weeping and disliked it, but now her chin and lips began to\r\n",
      "tremble and the tears welled up. Perhaps it was not possible for\r\n",
      "Lydgate, under the double stress of outward material difficulty and of\r\n",
      "his own proud resistance to humiliating consequences, to imagine fully\r\n",
      "what this sudden trial was to a young creature who had known nothing\r\n",
      "but indulgence, and whose dreams had all been of new indulgence, more\r\n",
      "exactly to her taste. But he did wish to spare her as much as he could,\r\n",
      "and her tears cut him to the heart. He could not speak again\r\n",
      "immediately; but Rosamond did not go on sobbing: she tried to conquer\r\n",
      "her agitation and wiped away her tears, continuing to look before her\r\n",
      "at the mantel-piece.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Try not to grieve, darling,” said Lydgate, turning his eyes up towards\r\n",
      "her. That she had chosen to move away from him in this moment of her\r\n",

      "would make proper representations to them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is idle Rosamond,” said Lydgate, angrily. “You must learn to take\r\n",
      "my judgment on questions you don’t understand. I have made necessary\r\n",
      "arrangements, and they must be carried out. As to friends, I have no\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“We have no time to waste now on unnecessary words, dear,” said\r\n",
      "Lydgate, trying to be gentle again. “There are some details that I want\r\n",
      "to consider with you. Dover says he will take a good deal of the plate\r\n",
      "back again, and any of the jewellery we like. He really behaves very\r\n",
      "well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are we to go without spoons and forks then?” said Rosamond, whose very\r\n",
      "lips seemed to get thinner with the thinness of her utterance. She was\r\n",
      "determined to make no further resistance or suggestions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no, dear!” said Lydgate. “But look here,” he continued, drawing a\r\n",
      "paper from his pocket and opening it; “here is Dover’s account. See, I\r\n",
      "have marked a number of articles, which if we returned them would\r\n",
      "reduce the amount by thirty pounds and more. I have not marked any of\r\n",
      "the jewellery.” Lydgate had really felt this point of the jewellery\r\n",
      "very bitter to himself; but he had overcome the feeling by severe\r\n",
      "argument. He could not propose to Rosamond that she should return any\r\n",
      "particular present of his, but he had told himself that he was bound to\r\n",
      "put Dover’s offer before her, and her inward prompting might make the\r\n",
      "affair easy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is useless for me to look, Tertius,” said Rosamond, calmly; “you\r\n",
      "will return what you please.” She would not turn her eyes on the paper,\r\n",
      "and Lydgate, flushing up to the roots of his hair, drew it back and let\r\n",
      "it fall on his knee. Meanwhile Rosamond quietly went out of the room,\r\n",
      "leaving Lydgate helpless and wondering. Was she not coming back? It\r\n",
      "seemed that she had no more identified herself with him than if they\r\n",
      "had been creatures of different species and opposing interests. He\r\n",
      "tossed his head and thrust his hands deep into his pockets with a sort\r\n",
      "of vengeance. There was still science—there were still good objects to\r\n",
      "work for. He must give a tug still—all the stronger because other\r\n",
      "satisfactions were going.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the door opened and Rosamond re-entered. She carried the leather\r\n",
      "box containing the amethysts, and a tiny ornamental basket which\r\n",
      "contained other boxes, and laying them on the chair where she had been\r\n",
      "sitting, she said, with perfect propriety in her air—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is all the jewellery you ever gave me. You can return what you\r\n",
      "like of it, and of the plate also. You will not, of course, expect me\r\n",
      "to stay at home to-morrow. I shall go to papa’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To many women the look Lydgate cast at her would have been more\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, in the evening. Of course I shall not mention the subject to\r\n",

      "irreproachably than she was behaving; and she went to sit down at her\r\n",
      "work-table. Lydgate sat meditating a minute or two, and the result was\r\n",
      "that he said, with some of the old emotion in his tone—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now we have been united, Rosy, you should not leave me to myself in\r\n",
      "the first trouble that has come.”\r\n",

      "question of pride, which I feel just as much as you can, it is surely\r\n",
      "better to manage the thing ourselves, and let the servants see as\r\n",
      "little of it as possible; and since you are my wife, there is no\r\n",
      "hindering your share in my disgraces—if there were disgraces.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "his kiss and returned it faintly, and in this way an appearance of\r\n",

      "what she held the stupid and even reprehensible step of giving up the\r\n",
      "Church to take to such a business as Mr. Garth’s. Hence Fred talked by\r\n",

      "much too serious to gossip about. He remembered Will’s irritability\r\n",
      "when he had mentioned Mrs. Casaubon, and was the more circumspect. On\r\n",
      "the whole his surmises, in addition to what he knew of the fact,\r\n",

      "understand the vacillation which kept him at Middlemarch after he had\r\n",
      "said that he should go away. It was significant of the separateness\r\n",
      "between Lydgate’s mind and Rosamond’s that he had no impulse to speak\r\n",
      "to her on the subject; indeed, he did not quite trust her reticence\r\n",

      "the fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the\r\n",
      "handbills of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, whose acquaintance with the history\r\n",
      "of art enabled him to state that the hall furniture, to be sold without\r\n",
      "reserve, comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of Gibbons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of\r\n",

      "issue from Middlemarch called the London Road, which was also the road\r\n",
      "to the New Hospital and to Mr. Bulstrode’s retired residence, known as\r\n",
      "the Shrubs. In short, the auction was as good as a fair, and drew all\r\n",
      "classes with leisure at command: to some, who risked making bids in\r\n",
      "order simply to raise prices, it was almost equal to betting at the\r\n",

      "are weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly\r\n",
      "agreeable; and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve\r\n",
      "when we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary. In such\r\n",
      "states of mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning\r\n",
      "towards miracle: impossible to conceive how our wish could be\r\n",
      "fulfilled, still—very wonderful things have happened! Will did not\r\n",
      "confess this weakness to himself, but he lingered. What was the use of\r\n",
      "going to London at that time of the year? The Rugby men who would\r\n",
      "remember him were not there; and so far as political writing was\r\n",
      "concerned, he would rather for a few weeks go on with the “Pioneer.” At\r\n",
      "the present moment, however, when Mr. Bulstrode was speaking to him, he\r\n",
      "had both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not\r\n",
      "to go till he had once more seen Dorothea. Hence he replied that he had\r\n",
      "reasons for deferring his departure a little, and would be happy to go\r\n",
      "to the sale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was in a defiant mood, his consciousness being deeply stung with\r\n",
      "the thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact\r\n",
      "tantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low designs\r\n",
      "which were to be frustrated by a disposal of property. Like most people\r\n",
      "who assert their freedom with regard to conventional distinction, he\r\n",
      "was prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any one who might\r\n",
      "hint that he had personal reasons for that assertion—that there was\r\n",
      "anything in his blood, his bearing, or his character to which he gave\r\n",
      "the mask of an opinion. When he was under an irritating impression of\r\n",
      "this kind he would go about for days with a defiant look, the color\r\n",
      "changing in his transparent skin as if he were on the _qui vive_,\r\n",
      "watching for something which he had to dart upon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale, and those\r\n",
      "who had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright\r\n",
      "enjoyment would have been struck with a contrast. He was not sorry to\r\n",
      "have this occasion for appearing in public before the Middlemarch\r\n",
      "tribes of Toller, Hackbutt, and the rest, who looked down on him as an\r\n",
      "adventurer, and were in a state of brutal ignorance about Dante—who\r\n",
      "sneered at his Polish blood, and were themselves of a breed very much\r\n",
      "in need of crossing. He stood in a conspicuous place not far from the\r\n",
      "auctioneer, with a fore-finger in each side-pocket and his head thrown\r\n",
      "backward, not caring to speak to anybody, though he had been cordially\r\n",
      "welcomed as a connoiss_ure_ by Mr. Trumbull, who was enjoying the\r\n",
      "utmost activity of his great faculties.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their\r\n",
      "powers of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer\r\n",
      "keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic\r\n",
      "knowledge. Some saturnine, sour-blooded persons might object to be\r\n",
      "constantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot-jacks to\r\n",
      "“Berghems;” but Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had a kindly liquid in his veins;\r\n",
      "he was an admirer by nature, and would have liked to have the universe\r\n",
      "under his hammer, feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his\r\n",
      "recommendation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Mrs. Larcher’s drawing-room furniture was enough for him.\r\n",
      "When Will Ladislaw had come in, a second fender, said to have been\r\n",
      "forgotten in its right place, suddenly claimed the auctioneer’s\r\n",
      "enthusiasm, which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising\r\n",
      "those things most which were most in need of praise. The fender was of\r\n",
      "polished steel, with much lancet-shaped open-work and a sharp edge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, ladies,” said he, “I shall appeal to you. Here is a fender which\r\n",
      "at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve, being, as I\r\n",
      "may say, for quality of steel and quaintness of design, a kind of\r\n",
      "thing”—here Mr. Trumbull dropped his voice and became slightly nasal,\r\n",
      "trimming his outlines with his left finger—“that might not fall in with\r\n",
      "ordinary tastes. Allow me to tell you that by-and-by this style of\r\n",
      "workmanship will be the only one in vogue—half-a-crown, you said? thank\r\n",
      "you—going at half-a-crown, this characteristic fender; and I have\r\n",
      "particular information that the antique style is very much sought after\r\n",
      "in high quarters. Three shillings—three-and-sixpence—hold it well up,\r\n",
      "Joseph! Look, ladies, at the chastity of the design—I have no doubt\r\n",
      "myself that it was turned out in the last century! Four shillings, Mr.\r\n",
      "Mawmsey?—four shillings.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s not a thing I would put in _my_ drawing-room,” said Mrs. Mawmsey,\r\n",
      "audibly, for the warning of the rash husband. “I wonder _at_ Mrs.\r\n",
      "Larcher. Every blessed child’s head that fell against it would be cut\r\n",
      "in two. The edge is like a knife.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite true,” rejoined Mr. Trumbull, quickly, “and most uncommonly\r\n",
      "useful to have a fender at hand that will cut, if you have a leather\r\n",
      "shoe-tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand:\r\n",
      "many a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him\r\n",
      "down. Gentlemen, here’s a fender that if you had the misfortune to hang\r\n",
      "yourselves would cut you down in no time—with astonishing\r\n",
      "celerity—four-and-sixpence—five—five-and-sixpence—an appropriate thing\r\n",
      "for a spare bedroom where there was a four-poster and a guest a little\r\n",
      "out of his mind—six shillings—thank you, Mr. Clintup—going at six\r\n",
      "shillings—going—gone!” The auctioneer’s glance, which had been\r\n",
      "searching round him with a preternatural susceptibility to all signs of\r\n",
      "bidding, here dropped on the paper before him, and his voice too\r\n",
      "dropped into a tone of indifferent despatch as he said, “Mr. Clintup.\r\n",
      "Be handy, Joseph.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that\r\n",
      "joke on,” said Mr. Clintup, laughing low and apologetically to his next\r\n",
      "neighbor. He was a diffident though distinguished nurseryman, and\r\n",
      "feared that the audience might regard his bid as a foolish one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Joseph had brought a trayful of small articles. “Now,\r\n",
      "ladies,” said Mr. Trumbull, taking up one of the articles, “this tray\r\n",
      "contains a very recherchy lot—a collection of trifles for the\r\n",
      "drawing-room table—and trifles make the sum _of_ human things—nothing\r\n",
      "more important than trifles—(yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes, by-and-by)—but\r\n",
      "pass the tray round, Joseph—these bijoux must be examined, ladies. This\r\n",
      "I have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance—a sort of practical\r\n",
      "rebus, I may call it: here, you see, it looks like an elegant\r\n",
      "heart-shaped box, portable—for the pocket; there, again, it becomes\r\n",
      "like a splendid double flower—an ornament for the table; and now”—Mr.\r\n",
      "Trumbull allowed the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of\r\n",
      "heart-shaped leaves—“a book of riddles! No less than five hundred\r\n",
      "printed in a beautiful red. Gentlemen, if I had less of a conscience, I\r\n",
      "should not wish you to bid high for this lot—I have a longing for it\r\n",
      "myself. What can promote innocent mirth, and I may say virtue, more\r\n",
      "than a good riddle?—it hinders profane language, and attaches a man to\r\n",
      "the society of refined females. This ingenious article itself, without\r\n",
      "the elegant domino-box, card-basket, &c., ought alone to give a high\r\n",
      "price to the lot. Carried in the pocket it might make an individual\r\n",
      "welcome in any society. Four shillings, sir?—four shillings for this\r\n",
      "remarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras. Here is a\r\n",
      "sample: ‘How must you spell honey to make it catch lady-birds?\r\n",
      "Answer—money.’ You hear?—lady-birds—honey money. This is an amusement\r\n",
      "to sharpen the intellect; it has a sting—it has what we call satire,\r\n",
      "and wit without indecency. Four-and-sixpence—five shillings.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bidding ran on with warming rivalry. Mr. Bowyer was a bidder, and\r\n",
      "this was too exasperating. Bowyer couldn’t afford it, and only wanted\r\n",
      "to hinder every other man from making a figure. The current carried\r\n",
      "even Mr. Horrock with it, but this committal of himself to an opinion\r\n",
      "fell from him with so little sacrifice of his neutral expression, that\r\n",
      "the bid might not have been detected as his but for the friendly oaths\r\n",
      "of Mr. Bambridge, who wanted to know what Horrock would do with blasted\r\n",
      "stuff only fit for haberdashers given over to that state of perdition\r\n",
      "which the horse-dealer so cordially recognized in the majority of\r\n",
      "earthly existences. The lot was finally knocked down at a guinea to Mr.\r\n",
      "Spilkins, a young Slender of the neighborhood, who was reckless with\r\n",
      "his pocket-money and felt his want of memory for riddles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, Trumbull, this is too bad—you’ve been putting some old maid’s\r\n",
      "rubbish into the sale,” murmured Mr. Toller, getting close to the\r\n",
      "auctioneer. “I want to see how the prints go, and I must be off soon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Im_mediately, Mr. Toller. It was only an act of benevolence which\r\n",
      "your noble heart would approve. Joseph! quick with the prints—Lot 235.\r\n",
      "Now, gentlemen, you who are connoiss_ures_, you are going to have a\r\n",
      "treat. Here is an engraving of the Duke of Wellington surrounded by his\r\n",
      "staff on the Field of Waterloo; and notwithstanding recent events which\r\n",
      "have, as it were, enveloped our great Hero in a cloud, I will be bold\r\n",
      "to say—for a man in my line must not be blown about by political\r\n",
      "winds—that a finer subject—of the modern order, belonging to our own\r\n",
      "time and epoch—the understanding of man could hardly conceive: angels\r\n",
      "might, perhaps, but not men, sirs, not men.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who painted it?” said Mr. Powderell, much impressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a proof before the letter, Mr. Powderell—the painter is not\r\n",
      "known,” answered Trumbull, with a certain gaspingness in his last\r\n",
      "words, after which he pursed up his lips and stared round him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll bid a pound!” said Mr. Powderell, in a tone of resolved emotion,\r\n",
      "as of a man ready to put himself in the breach. Whether from awe or\r\n",
      "pity, nobody raised the price on him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next came two Dutch prints which Mr. Toller had been eager for, and\r\n",
      "after he had secured them he went away. Other prints, and afterwards\r\n",
      "some paintings, were sold to leading Middlemarchers who had come with a\r\n",
      "special desire for them, and there was a more active movement of the\r\n",
      "audience in and out; some, who had bought what they wanted, going away,\r\n",
      "others coming in either quite newly or from a temporary visit to the\r\n",
      "refreshments which were spread under the marquee on the lawn. It was\r\n",
      "this marquee that Mr. Bambridge was bent on buying, and he appeared to\r\n",
      "like looking inside it frequently, as a foretaste of its possession. On\r\n",
      "the last occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring with\r\n",
      "him a new companion, a stranger to Mr. Trumbull and every one else,\r\n",
      "whose appearance, however, led to the supposition that he might be a\r\n",
      "relative of the horse-dealer’s—also “given to indulgence.” His large\r\n",
      "whiskers, imposing swagger, and swing of the leg, made him a striking\r\n",
      "figure; but his suit of black, rather shabby at the edges, caused the\r\n",
      "prejudicial inference that he was not able to afford himself as much\r\n",
      "indulgence as he liked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who is it you’ve picked up, Bam?” said Mr. Horrock, aside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ask him yourself,” returned Mr. Bambridge. “He said he’d just turned\r\n",
      "in from the road.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Horrock eyed the stranger, who was leaning back against his stick\r\n",
      "with one hand, using his toothpick with the other, and looking about\r\n",
      "him with a certain restlessness apparently under the silence imposed on\r\n",
      "him by circumstances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length the “Supper at Emmaus” was brought forward, to Will’s immense\r\n",
      "relief, for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that he had\r\n",
      "drawn back a little and leaned his shoulder against the wall just\r\n",
      "behind the auctioneer. He now came forward again, and his eye caught\r\n",
      "the conspicuous stranger, who, rather to his surprise, was staring at\r\n",
      "him markedly. But Will was immediately appealed to by Mr. Trumbull.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes; this interests you as a connoiss_ure_, I\r\n",
      "think. It is some pleasure,” the auctioneer went on with a rising\r\n",
      "fervor, “to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and\r\n",
      "gentlemen—a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on\r\n",
      "a level with his judgment. It is a painting of the Italian school—by\r\n",
      "the celebrated _Guydo_, the greatest painter in the world, the chief of\r\n",
      "the Old Masters, as they are called—I take it, because they were up to\r\n",
      "a thing or two beyond most of us—in possession of secrets now lost to\r\n",
      "the bulk of mankind. Let me tell you, gentlemen, I have seen a great\r\n",
      "many pictures by the Old Masters, and they are not all up to this\r\n",
      "mark—some of them are darker than you might like and not family\r\n",
      "subjects. But here is a _Guydo_—the frame alone is worth pounds—which\r\n",
      "any lady might be proud to hang up—a suitable thing for what we call a\r\n",
      "refectory in a charitable institution, if any gentleman of the\r\n",
      "Corporation wished to show his munifi_cence_. Turn it a little, sir?\r\n",
      "yes. Joseph, turn it a little towards Mr. Ladislaw—Mr. Ladislaw, having\r\n",
      "been abroad, understands the merit of these things, you observe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All eyes were for a moment turned towards Will, who said, coolly, “Five\r\n",
      "pounds.” The auctioneer burst out in deep remonstrance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! Mr. Ladislaw! the frame alone is worth that. Ladies and gentlemen,\r\n",
      "for the credit of the town! Suppose it should be discovered hereafter\r\n",
      "that a gem of art has been amongst us in this town, and nobody in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch awake to it. Five guineas—five seven-six—five ten. Still,\r\n",
      "ladies, still! It is a gem, and ‘Full many a gem,’ as the poet says,\r\n",
      "has been allowed to go at a nominal price because the public knew no\r\n",
      "better, because it was offered in circles where there was—I was going\r\n",
      "to say a low feeling, but no!—Six pounds—six guineas—a _Guydo_ of the\r\n",
      "first order going at six guineas—it is an insult to religion, ladies;\r\n",
      "it touches us all as Christians, gentlemen, that a subject like this\r\n",
      "should go at such a low figure—six pounds ten—seven—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bidding was brisk, and Will continued to share in it, remembering\r\n",
      "that Mrs. Bulstrode had a strong wish for the picture, and thinking\r\n",
      "that he might stretch the price to twelve pounds. But it was knocked\r\n",
      "down to him at ten guineas, whereupon he pushed his way towards the\r\n",
      "bow-window and went out. He chose to go under the marquee to get a\r\n",
      "glass of water, being hot and thirsty: it was empty of other visitors,\r\n",
      "and he asked the woman in attendance to fetch him some fresh water; but\r\n",
      "before she was well gone he was annoyed to see entering the florid\r\n",
      "stranger who had stared at him. It struck Will at this moment that the\r\n",
      "man might be one of those political parasitic insects of the bloated\r\n",
      "kind who had once or twice claimed acquaintance with him as having\r\n",
      "heard him speak on the Reform question, and who might think of getting\r\n",
      "a shilling by news. In this light his person, already rather heating to\r\n",
      "behold on a summer’s day, appeared the more disagreeable; and Will,\r\n",
      "half-seated on the elbow of a garden-chair, turned his eyes carefully\r\n",
      "away from the comer. But this signified little to our acquaintance Mr.\r\n",
      "Raffles, who never hesitated to thrust himself on unwilling\r\n",
      "observation, if it suited his purpose to do so. He moved a step or two\r\n",
      "till he was in front of Will, and said with full-mouthed haste, “Excuse\r\n",
      "me, Mr. Ladislaw—was your mother’s name Sarah Dunkirk?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will, starting to his feet, moved backward a step, frowning, and saying\r\n",
      "with some fierceness, “Yes, sir, it was. And what is that to you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was in Will’s nature that the first spark it threw out was a direct\r\n",
      "answer of the question and a challenge of the consequences. To have\r\n",
      "said, “What is that to you?” in the first instance, would have seemed\r\n",
      "like shuffling—as if he minded who knew anything about his origin!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raffles on his side had not the same eagerness for a collision which\r\n",
      "was implied in Ladislaw’s threatening air. The slim young fellow with\r\n",
      "his girl’s complexion looked like a tiger-cat ready to spring on him.\r\n",
      "Under such circumstances Mr. Raffles’s pleasure in annoying his company\r\n",
      "was kept in abeyance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No offence, my good sir, no offence! I only remember your mother—knew\r\n",
      "her when she was a girl. But it is your father that you feature, sir. I\r\n",
      "had the pleasure of seeing your father too. Parents alive, Mr.\r\n",
      "Ladislaw?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No!” thundered Will, in the same attitude as before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Should be glad to do you a service, Mr. Ladislaw—by Jove, I should!\r\n",
      "Hope to meet again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hereupon Raffles, who had lifted his hat with the last words, turned\r\n",
      "himself round with a swing of his leg and walked away. Will looked\r\n",
      "after him a moment, and could see that he did not re-enter the\r\n",
      "auction-room, but appeared to be walking towards the road. For an\r\n",
      "instant he thought that he had been foolish not to let the man go on\r\n",
      "talking;—but no! on the whole he preferred doing without knowledge from\r\n",
      "that source.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Later in the evening, however, Raffles overtook him in the street, and\r\n",
      "appearing either to have forgotten the roughness of his former\r\n",
      "reception or to intend avenging it by a forgiving familiarity, greeted\r\n",
      "him jovially and walked by his side, remarking at first on the\r\n",
      "pleasantness of the town and neighborhood. Will suspected that the man\r\n",
      "had been drinking and was considering how to shake him off when Raffles\r\n",
      "said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve been abroad myself, Mr. Ladislaw—I’ve seen the world—used to\r\n",
      "parley-vous a little. It was at Boulogne I saw your father—a most\r\n",
      "uncommon likeness you are of him, by Jove! mouth—nose—eyes—hair turned\r\n",
      "off your brow just like his—a little in the foreign style. John Bull\r\n",
      "doesn’t do much of that. But your father was very ill when I saw him.\r\n",
      "Lord, lord! hands you might see through. You were a small youngster\r\n",
      "then. Did he get well?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Will, curtly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! Well! I’ve often wondered what became of your mother. She ran away\r\n",
      "from her friends when she was a young lass—a proud-spirited lass, and\r\n",
      "pretty, by Jove! I knew the reason why she ran away,” said Raffles,\r\n",
      "winking slowly as he looked sideways at Will.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You know nothing dishonorable of her, sir,” said Will, turning on him\r\n",
      "rather savagely. But Mr. Raffles just now was not sensitive to shades\r\n",
      "of manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not a bit!” said he, tossing his head decisively. “She was a little\r\n",

      "high salary. They didn’t mind her running away at first—godly folks,\r\n",
      "sir, very godly—and she was for the stage. The son was alive then, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "No more was said on the subject until the next day, when Mr. Bulstrode\r\n",
      "had returned from the town and was dressing for dinner. His wife, not\r\n",
      "sure that he was come home, looked into his dressing-room and saw him\r\n",
      "with his coat and cravat off, leaning one arm on a chest of drawers and\r\n",
      "staring absently at the ground. He started nervously and looked up as\r\n",

      "Physically Mr. Bulstrode did not want the vinegar, but morally the\r\n",
      "affectionate attention soothed him. Though always polite, it was his\r\n",
      "habit to receive such services with marital coolness, as his wife’s\r\n",
      "duty. But to-day, while she was bending over him, he said, “You are\r\n",
      "very good, Harriet,” in a tone which had something new in it to her\r\n",
      "ear; she did not know exactly what the novelty was, but her woman’s\r\n",

      "“Is he quite gone away?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, anxiously; but for\r\n",
      "certain reasons she refrained from adding, “It was very disagreeable to\r\n",
      "hear him calling himself a friend of yours.” At that moment she would\r\n",
      "not have liked to say anything which implied her habitual consciousness\r\n",
      "that her husband’s earlier connections were not quite on a level with\r\n",
      "her own. Not that she knew much about them. That her husband had at\r\n",
      "first been employed in a bank, that he had afterwards entered into what\r\n",
      "he called city business and gained a fortune before he was\r\n",
      "three-and-thirty, that he had married a widow who was much older than\r\n",
      "himself—a Dissenter, and in other ways probably of that disadvantageous\r\n",
      "quality usually perceptible in a first wife if inquired into with the\r\n",
      "dispassionate judgment of a second—was almost as much as she had cared\r\n",
      "to learn beyond the glimpses which Mr. Bulstrode’s narrative\r\n",
      "occasionally gave of his early bent towards religion, his inclination\r\n",
      "to be a preacher, and his association with missionary and philanthropic\r\n",
      "efforts. She believed in him as an excellent man whose piety carried a\r\n",
      "peculiar eminence in belonging to a layman, whose influence had turned\r\n",
      "her own mind toward seriousness, and whose share of perishable good had\r\n",
      "been the means of raising her own position. But she also liked to think\r\n",
      "that it was well in every sense for Mr. Bulstrode to have won the hand\r\n",
      "of Harriet Vincy; whose family was undeniable in a Middlemarch light—a\r\n",
      "better light surely than any thrown in London thoroughfares or\r\n",
      "dissenting chapel-yards. The unreformed provincial mind distrusted\r\n",
      "London; and while true religion was everywhere saving, honest Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode was convinced that to be saved in the Church was more\r\n",
      "respectable. She so much wished to ignore towards others that her\r\n",
      "husband had ever been a London Dissenter, that she liked to keep it out\r\n",
      "of sight even in talking to him. He was quite aware of this; indeed in\r\n",
      "some respects he was rather afraid of this ingenuous wife, whose\r\n",
      "imitative piety and native worldliness were equally sincere, who had\r\n",
      "nothing to be ashamed of, and whom he had married out of a thorough\r\n",
      "inclination still subsisting. But his fears were such as belong to a\r\n",
      "man who cares to maintain his recognized supremacy: the loss of high\r\n",
      "consideration from his wife, as from every one else who did not clearly\r\n",
      "hate him out of enmity to the truth, would be as the beginning of death\r\n",
      "to him. When she said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is he quite gone away?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I trust so,” he answered, with an effort to throw as much sober\r\n",
      "unconcern into his tone as possible!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in truth Mr. Bulstrode was very far from a state of quiet trust. In\r\n",
      "the interview at the Bank, Raffles had made it evident that his\r\n",
      "eagerness to torment was almost as strong in him as any other greed. He\r\n",
      "had frankly said that he had turned out of the way to come to\r\n",
      "Middlemarch, just to look about him and see whether the neighborhood\r\n",
      "would suit him to live in. He had certainly had a few debts to pay more\r\n",
      "than he expected, but the two hundred pounds were not gone yet: a cool\r\n",
      "five-and-twenty would suffice him to go away with for the present. What\r\n",
      "he had wanted chiefly was to see his friend Nick and family, and know\r\n",
      "all about the prosperity of a man to whom he was so much attached.\r\n",
      "By-and-by he might come back for a longer stay. This time Raffles\r\n",
      "declined to be “seen off the premises,” as he expressed it—declined to\r\n",
      "quit Middlemarch under Bulstrode’s eyes. He meant to go by coach the\r\n",
      "next day—if he chose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode felt himself helpless. Neither threats nor coaxing could\r\n",
      "avail: he could not count on any persistent fear nor on any promise. On\r\n",
      "the contrary, he felt a cold certainty at his heart that Raffles—unless\r\n",
      "providence sent death to hinder him—would come back to Middlemarch\r\n",
      "before long. And that certainty was a terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not that he was in danger of legal punishment or of beggary: he\r\n",
      "was in danger only of seeing disclosed to the judgment of his neighbors\r\n",
      "and the mournful perception of his wife certain facts of his past life\r\n",
      "which would render him an object of scorn and an opprobrium of the\r\n",
      "religion with which he had diligently associated himself. The terror of\r\n",
      "being judged sharpens the memory: it sends an inevitable glare over\r\n",
      "that long-unvisited past which has been habitually recalled only in\r\n",
      "general phrases. Even without memory, the life is bound into one by a\r\n",
      "zone of dependence in growth and decay; but intense memory forces a man\r\n",
      "to own his blameworthy past. With memory set smarting like a reopened\r\n",
      "wound, a man’s past is not simply a dead history, an outworn\r\n",
      "preparation of the present: it is not a repented error shaken loose\r\n",
      "from the life: it is a still quivering part of himself, bringing\r\n",
      "shudders and bitter flavors and the tinglings of a merited shame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Into this second life Bulstrode’s past had now risen, only the\r\n",
      "pleasures of it seeming to have lost their quality. Night and day,\r\n",
      "without interruption save of brief sleep which only wove retrospect and\r\n",
      "fear into a fantastic present, he felt the scenes of his earlier life\r\n",
      "coming between him and everything else, as obstinately as when we look\r\n",
      "through the window from a lighted room, the objects we turn our backs\r\n",
      "on are still before us, instead of the grass and the trees. The\r\n",
      "successive events inward and outward were there in one view: though\r\n",
      "each might be dwelt on in turn, the rest still kept their hold in the\r\n",
      "consciousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more he saw himself the young banker’s clerk, with an agreeable\r\n",
      "person, as clever in figures as he was fluent in speech and fond of\r\n",
      "theological definition: an eminent though young member of a Calvinistic\r\n",
      "dissenting church at Highbury, having had striking experience in\r\n",
      "conviction of sin and sense of pardon. Again he heard himself called\r\n",
      "for as Brother Bulstrode in prayer meetings, speaking on religious\r\n",
      "platforms, preaching in private houses. Again he felt himself thinking\r\n",
      "of the ministry as possibly his vocation, and inclined towards\r\n",
      "missionary labor. That was the happiest time of his life: that was the\r\n",
      "spot he would have chosen now to awake in and find the rest a dream.\r\n",
      "The people among whom Brother Bulstrode was distinguished were very\r\n",
      "few, but they were very near to him, and stirred his satisfaction the\r\n",
      "more; his power stretched through a narrow space, but he felt its\r\n",
      "effect the more intensely. He believed without effort in the peculiar\r\n",
      "work of grace within him, and in the signs that God intended him for\r\n",
      "special instrumentality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then came the moment of transition; it was with the sense of promotion\r\n",
      "he had when he, an orphan educated at a commercial charity-school, was\r\n",
      "invited to a fine villa belonging to Mr. Dunkirk, the richest man in\r\n",
      "the congregation. Soon he became an intimate there, honored for his\r\n",
      "piety by the wife, marked out for his ability by the husband, whose\r\n",
      "wealth was due to a flourishing city and west-end trade. That was the\r\n",
      "setting-in of a new current for his ambition, directing his prospects\r\n",
      "of “instrumentality” towards the uniting of distinguished religious\r\n",
      "gifts with successful business.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By-and-by came a decided external leading: a confidential subordinate\r\n",
      "partner died, and nobody seemed to the principal so well fitted to fill\r\n",
      "the severely felt vacancy as his young friend Bulstrode, if he would\r\n",
      "become confidential accountant. The offer was accepted. The business\r\n",
      "was a pawnbroker’s, of the most magnificent sort both in extent and\r\n",
      "profits; and on a short acquaintance with it Bulstrode became aware\r\n",
      "that one source of magnificent profit was the easy reception of any\r\n",
      "goods offered, without strict inquiry as to where they came from. But\r\n",
      "there was a branch house at the west end, and no pettiness or dinginess\r\n",
      "to give suggestions of shame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He remembered his first moments of shrinking. They were private, and\r\n",
      "were filled with arguments; some of these taking the form of prayer.\r\n",
      "The business was established and had old roots; is it not one thing to\r\n",
      "set up a new gin-palace and another to accept an investment in an old\r\n",
      "one? The profits made out of lost souls—where can the line be drawn at\r\n",
      "which they begin in human transactions? Was it not even God’s way of\r\n",
      "saving His chosen? “Thou knowest,”—the young Bulstrode had said then,\r\n",
      "as the older Bulstrode was saying now—“Thou knowest how loose my soul\r\n",
      "sits from these things—how I view them all as implements for tilling\r\n",
      "Thy garden rescued here and there from the wilderness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Metaphors and precedents were not wanting; peculiar spiritual\r\n",
      "experiences were not wanting which at last made the retention of his\r\n",
      "position seem a service demanded of him: the vista of a fortune had\r\n",
      "already opened itself, and Bulstrode’s shrinking remained private. Mr.\r\n",
      "Dunkirk had never expected that there would be any shrinking at all: he\r\n",
      "had never conceived that trade had anything to do with the scheme of\r\n",
      "salvation. And it was true that Bulstrode found himself carrying on two\r\n",
      "distinct lives; his religious activity could not be incompatible with\r\n",
      "his business as soon as he had argued himself into not feeling it\r\n",
      "incompatible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mentally surrounded with that past again, Bulstrode had the same\r\n",
      "pleas—indeed, the years had been perpetually spinning them into\r\n",
      "intricate thickness, like masses of spider-web, padding the moral\r\n",
      "sensibility; nay, as age made egoism more eager but less enjoying, his\r\n",
      "soul had become more saturated with the belief that he did everything\r\n",
      "for God’s sake, being indifferent to it for his own. And yet—if he\r\n",
      "could be back in that far-off spot with his youthful poverty—why, then\r\n",
      "he would choose to be a missionary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the train of causes in which he had locked himself went on. There\r\n",
      "was trouble in the fine villa at Highbury. Years before, the only\r\n",
      "daughter had run away, defied her parents, and gone on the stage; and\r\n",
      "now the only boy died, and after a short time Mr. Dunkirk died also.\r\n",
      "The wife, a simple pious woman, left with all the wealth in and out of\r\n",
      "the magnificent trade, of which she never knew the precise nature, had\r\n",
      "come to believe in Bulstrode, and innocently adore him as women often\r\n",
      "adore their priest or “man-made” minister. It was natural that after a\r\n",
      "time marriage should have been thought of between them. But Mrs.\r\n",
      "Dunkirk had qualms and yearnings about her daughter, who had long been\r\n",
      "regarded as lost both to God and her parents. It was known that the\r\n",
      "daughter had married, but she was utterly gone out of sight. The\r\n",
      "mother, having lost her boy, imagined a grandson, and wished in a\r\n",
      "double sense to reclaim her daughter. If she were found, there would be\r\n",
      "a channel for property—perhaps a wide one—in the provision for several\r\n",
      "grandchildren. Efforts to find her must be made before Mrs. Dunkirk\r\n",
      "would marry again. Bulstrode concurred; but after advertisement as well\r\n",
      "as other modes of inquiry had been tried, the mother believed that her\r\n",
      "daughter was not to be found, and consented to marry without\r\n",
      "reservation of property.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The daughter had been found; but only one man besides Bulstrode knew\r\n",
      "it, and he was paid for keeping silence and carrying himself away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was the bare fact which Bulstrode was now forced to see in the\r\n",
      "rigid outline with which acts present themselves to onlookers. But for\r\n",
      "himself at that distant time, and even now in burning memory, the fact\r\n",
      "was broken into little sequences, each justified as it came by\r\n",
      "reasonings which seemed to prove it righteous. Bulstrode’s course up to\r\n",
      "that time had, he thought, been sanctioned by remarkable providences,\r\n",
      "appearing to point the way for him to be the agent in making the best\r\n",
      "use of a large property and withdrawing it from perversion. Death and\r\n",
      "other striking dispositions, such as feminine trustfulness, had come;\r\n",
      "and Bulstrode would have adopted Cromwell’s words—“Do you call these\r\n",
      "bare events? The Lord pity you!” The events were comparatively small,\r\n",
      "but the essential condition was there—namely, that they were in favor\r\n",
      "of his own ends. It was easy for him to settle what was due from him to\r\n",
      "others by inquiring what were God’s intentions with regard to himself.\r\n",
      "Could it be for God’s service that this fortune should in any\r\n",
      "considerable proportion go to a young woman and her husband who were\r\n",
      "given up to the lightest pursuits, and might scatter it abroad in\r\n",
      "triviality—people who seemed to lie outside the path of remarkable\r\n",
      "providences? Bulstrode had never said to himself beforehand, “The\r\n",
      "daughter shall not be found”—nevertheless when the moment came he kept\r\n",
      "her existence hidden; and when other moments followed, he soothed the\r\n",
      "mother with consolation in the probability that the unhappy young woman\r\n",
      "might be no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were hours in which Bulstrode felt that his action was\r\n",
      "unrighteous; but how could he go back? He had mental exercises, called\r\n",
      "himself nought, laid hold on redemption, and went on in his course of\r\n",
      "instrumentality. And after five years Death again came to widen his\r\n",
      "path, by taking away his wife. He did gradually withdraw his capital,\r\n",
      "but he did not make the sacrifices requisite to put an end to the\r\n",
      "business, which was carried on for thirteen years afterwards before it\r\n",
      "finally collapsed. Meanwhile Nicholas Bulstrode had used his hundred\r\n",
      "thousand discreetly, and was become provincially, solidly important—a\r\n",
      "banker, a Churchman, a public benefactor; also a sleeping partner in\r\n",
      "trading concerns, in which his ability was directed to economy in the\r\n",
      "raw material, as in the case of the dyes which rotted Mr. Vincy’s silk.\r\n",
      "And now, when this respectability had lasted undisturbed for nearly\r\n",
      "thirty years—when all that preceded it had long lain benumbed in the\r\n",
      "consciousness—that past had risen and immersed his thought as if with\r\n",
      "the terrible irruption of a new sense overburthening the feeble being.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, in his conversation with Raffles, he had learned something\r\n",
      "momentous, something which entered actively into the struggle of his\r\n",

      "coarse hypocrites, who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the\r\n",
      "sake of gulling the world, but Bulstrode was not one of them. He was\r\n",
      "simply a man whose desires had been stronger than his theoretic\r\n",
      "beliefs, and who had gradually explained the gratification of his\r\n",
      "desires into satisfactory agreement with those beliefs. If this be\r\n",
      "hypocrisy, it is a process which shows itself occasionally in us all,\r\n",
      "to whatever confession we belong, and whether we believe in the future\r\n",
      "perfection of our race or in the nearest date fixed for the end of the\r\n",
      "world; whether we regard the earth as a putrefying nidus for a saved\r\n",

      "The service he could do to the cause of religion had been through life\r\n",
      "the ground he alleged to himself for his choice of action: it had been\r\n",
      "the motive which he had poured out in his prayers. Who would use money\r\n",
      "and position better than he meant to use them? Who could surpass him in\r\n",
      "self-abhorrence and exaltation of God’s cause? And to Mr. Bulstrode\r\n",
      "God’s cause was something distinct from his own rectitude of conduct:\r\n",
      "it enforced a discrimination of God’s enemies, who were to be used\r\n",
      "merely as instruments, and whom it would be as well if possible to keep\r\n",
      "out of money and consequent influence. Also, profitable investments in\r\n",
      "trades where the power of the prince of this world showed its most\r\n",
      "active devices, became sanctified by a right application of the profits\r\n",
      "in the hands of God’s servant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This implicit reasoning is essentially no more peculiar to evangelical\r\n",
      "belief than the use of wide phrases for narrow motives is peculiar to\r\n",
      "Englishmen. There is no general doctrine which is not capable of eating\r\n",
      "out our morality if unchecked by the deep-seated habit of direct\r\n",
      "fellow-feeling with individual fellow-men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But a man who believes in something else than his own greed, has\r\n",
      "necessarily a conscience or standard to which he more or less adapts\r\n",
      "himself. Bulstrode’s standard had been his serviceableness to God’s\r\n",
      "cause: “I am sinful and nought—a vessel to be consecrated by use—but\r\n",
      "use me!”—had been the mould into which he had constrained his immense\r\n",
      "need of being something important and predominating. And now had come a\r\n",
      "moment in which that mould seemed in danger of being broken and utterly\r\n",
      "cast away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made him a\r\n",
      "stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of\r\n",
      "the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory? If this were to be the\r\n",
      "ruling of Providence, he was cast out from the temple as one who had\r\n",
      "brought unclean offerings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had long poured out utterances of repentance. But today a repentance\r\n",
      "had come which was of a bitterer flavor, and a threatening Providence\r\n",
      "urged him to a kind of propitiation which was not simply a doctrinal\r\n",
      "transaction. The divine tribunal had changed its aspect for him;\r\n",
      "self-prostration was no longer enough, and he must bring restitution in\r\n",
      "his hand. It was really before his God that Bulstrode was about to\r\n",
      "attempt such restitution as seemed possible: a great dread had seized\r\n",
      "his susceptible frame, and the scorching approach of shame wrought in\r\n",
      "him a new spiritual need. Night and day, while the resurgent\r\n",
      "threatening past was making a conscience within him, he was thinking by\r\n",
      "what means he could recover peace and trust—by what sacrifice he could\r\n",
      "stay the rod. His belief in these moments of dread was, that if he\r\n",
      "spontaneously did something right, God would save him from the\r\n",
      "consequences of wrong-doing. For religion can only change when the\r\n",
      "emotions which fill it are changed; and the religion of personal fear\r\n",
      "remains nearly at the level of the savage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had seen Raffles actually going away on the Brassing coach, and this\r\n",
      "was a temporary relief; it removed the pressure of an immediate dread,\r\n",
      "but did not put an end to the spiritual conflict and the need to win\r\n",
      "protection. At last he came to a difficult resolve, and wrote a letter\r\n",
      "to Will Ladislaw, begging him to be at the Shrubs that evening for a\r\n",
      "private interview at nine o’clock. Will had felt no particular surprise\r\n",
      "at the request, and connected it with some new notions about the\r\n",
      "“Pioneer;” but when he was shown into Mr. Bulstrode’s private room, he\r\n",
      "was struck with the painfully worn look on the banker’s face, and was\r\n",
      "going to say, “Are you ill?” when, checking himself in that abruptness,\r\n",
      "he only inquired after Mrs. Bulstrode, and her satisfaction with the\r\n",
      "picture bought for her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you, she is quite satisfied; she has gone out with her daughters\r\n",
      "this evening. I begged you to come, Mr. Ladislaw, because I have a\r\n",
      "communication of a very private—indeed, I will say, of a sacredly\r\n",
      "confidential nature, which I desire to make to you. Nothing, I dare\r\n",
      "say, has been farther from your thoughts than that there had been\r\n",
      "important ties in the past which could connect your history with mine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will felt something like an electric shock. He was already in a state\r\n",
      "of keen sensitiveness and hardly allayed agitation on the subject of\r\n",
      "ties in the past, and his presentiments were not agreeable. It seemed\r\n",
      "like the fluctuations of a dream—as if the action begun by that loud\r\n",
      "bloated stranger were being carried on by this pale-eyed sickly looking\r\n",
      "piece of respectability, whose subdued tone and glib formality of\r\n",
      "speech were at this moment almost as repulsive to him as their\r\n",
      "remembered contrast. He answered, with a marked change of color—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed, nothing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see before you, Mr. Ladislaw, a man who is deeply stricken. But\r\n",
      "for the urgency of conscience and the knowledge that I am before the\r\n",
      "bar of One who seeth not as man seeth, I should be under no compulsion\r\n",
      "to make the disclosure which has been my object in asking you to come\r\n",
      "here to-night. So far as human laws go, you have no claim on me\r\n",
      "whatever.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was even more uncomfortable than wondering. Mr. Bulstrode had\r\n",
      "paused, leaning his head on his hand, and looking at the floor. But he\r\n",
      "now fixed his examining glance on Will and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am told that your mother’s name was Sarah Dunkirk, and that she ran\r\n",
      "away from her friends to go on the stage. Also, that your father was at\r\n",
      "one time much emaciated by illness. May I ask if you can confirm these\r\n",
      "statements?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, they are all true,” said Will, struck with the order in which an\r\n",
      "inquiry had come, that might have been expected to be preliminary to\r\n",
      "the banker’s previous hints. But Mr. Bulstrode had to-night followed\r\n",
      "the order of his emotions; he entertained no doubt that the opportunity\r\n",
      "for restitution had come, and he had an overpowering impulse towards\r\n",
      "the penitential expression by which he was deprecating chastisement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know any particulars of your mother’s family?” he continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; she never liked to speak of them. She was a very generous,\r\n",
      "honorable woman,” said Will, almost angrily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do not wish to allege anything against her. Did she never mention\r\n",
      "her mother to you at all?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have heard her say that she thought her mother did not know the\r\n",
      "reason of her running away. She said ‘poor mother’ in a pitying tone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That mother became my wife,” said Bulstrode, and then paused a moment\r\n",
      "before he added, “you have a claim on me, Mr. Ladislaw: as I said\r\n",
      "before, not a legal claim, but one which my conscience recognizes. I\r\n",
      "was enriched by that marriage—a result which would probably not have\r\n",
      "taken place—certainly not to the same extent—if your grandmother could\r\n",
      "have discovered her daughter. That daughter, I gather, is no longer\r\n",
      "living!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Will, feeling suspicion and repugnance rising so strongly\r\n",
      "within him, that without quite knowing what he did, he took his hat\r\n",
      "from the floor and stood up. The impulse within him was to reject the\r\n",
      "disclosed connection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray be seated, Mr. Ladislaw,” said Bulstrode, anxiously. “Doubtless\r\n",
      "you are startled by the suddenness of this discovery. But I entreat\r\n",
      "your patience with one who is already bowed down by inward trial.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will reseated himself, feeling some pity which was half contempt for\r\n",
      "this voluntary self-abasement of an elderly man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is my wish, Mr. Ladislaw, to make amends for the deprivation which\r\n",
      "befell your mother. I know that you are without fortune, and I wish to\r\n",
      "supply you adequately from a store which would have probably already\r\n",
      "been yours had your grandmother been certain of your mother’s existence\r\n",
      "and been able to find her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode paused. He felt that he was performing a striking piece\r\n",
      "of scrupulosity in the judgment of his auditor, and a penitential act\r\n",
      "in the eyes of God. He had no clew to the state of Will Ladislaw’s\r\n",
      "mind, smarting as it was from the clear hints of Raffles, and with its\r\n",
      "natural quickness in construction stimulated by the expectation of\r\n",
      "discoveries which he would have been glad to conjure back into\r\n",
      "darkness. Will made no answer for several moments, till Mr. Bulstrode,\r\n",
      "who at the end of his speech had cast his eyes on the floor, now raised\r\n",
      "them with an examining glance, which Will met fully, saying—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose you did know of my mother’s existence, and knew where she\r\n",
      "might have been found.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode shrank—there was a visible quivering in his face and hands.\r\n",
      "He was totally unprepared to have his advances met in this way, or to\r\n",
      "find himself urged into more revelation than he had beforehand set down\r\n",
      "as needful. But at that moment he dared not tell a lie, and he felt\r\n",
      "suddenly uncertain of his ground which he had trodden with some\r\n",
      "confidence before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will not deny that you conjecture rightly,” he answered, with a\r\n",
      "faltering in his tone. “And I wish to make atonement to you as the one\r\n",
      "still remaining who has suffered a loss through me. You enter, I trust,\r\n",
      "into my purpose, Mr. Ladislaw, which has a reference to higher than\r\n",
      "merely human claims, and as I have already said, is entirely\r\n",
      "independent of any legal compulsion. I am ready to narrow my own\r\n",
      "resources and the prospects of my family by binding myself to allow you\r\n",
      "five hundred pounds yearly during my life, and to leave you a\r\n",
      "proportional capital at my death—nay, to do still more, if more should\r\n",
      "be definitely necessary to any laudable project on your part.” Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode had gone on to particulars in the expectation that these\r\n",
      "would work strongly on Ladislaw, and merge other feelings in grateful\r\n",
      "acceptance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Will was looking as stubborn as possible, with his lip pouting and\r\n",
      "his fingers in his side-pockets. He was not in the least touched, and\r\n",
      "said firmly,—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Before I make any reply to your proposition, Mr. Bulstrode, I must beg\r\n",
      "you to answer a question or two. Were you connected with the business\r\n",
      "by which that fortune you speak of was originally made?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode’s thought was, “Raffles has told him.” How could he\r\n",
      "refuse to answer when he had volunteered what drew forth the question?\r\n",
      "He answered, “Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And was that business—or was it not—a thoroughly dishonorable one—nay,\r\n",
      "one that, if its nature had been made public, might have ranked those\r\n",
      "concerned in it with thieves and convicts?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will’s tone had a cutting bitterness: he was moved to put his question\r\n",
      "as nakedly as he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode reddened with irrepressible anger. He had been prepared for a\r\n",
      "scene of self-abasement, but his intense pride and his habit of\r\n",
      "supremacy overpowered penitence, and even dread, when this young man,\r\n",
      "whom he had meant to benefit, turned on him with the air of a judge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The business was established before I became connected with it, sir;\r\n",
      "nor is it for you to institute an inquiry of that kind,” he answered,\r\n",
      "not raising his voice, but speaking with quick defiantness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, it is,” said Will, starting up again with his hat in his hand.\r\n",
      "“It is eminently mine to ask such questions, when I have to decide\r\n",
      "whether I will have transactions with you and accept your money. My\r\n",
      "unblemished honor is important to me. It is important to me to have no\r\n",
      "stain on my birth and connections. And now I find there is a stain\r\n",
      "which I can’t help. My mother felt it, and tried to keep as clear of it\r\n",
      "as she could, and so will I. You shall keep your ill-gotten money. If I\r\n",
      "had any fortune of my own, I would willingly pay it to any one who\r\n",
      "could disprove what you have told me. What I have to thank you for is\r\n",
      "that you kept the money till now, when I can refuse it. It ought to lie\r\n",
      "with a man’s self that he is a gentleman. Good-night, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode was going to speak, but Will, with determined quickness, was\r\n",
      "out of the room in an instant, and in another the hall-door had closed\r\n",
      "behind him. He was too strongly possessed with passionate rebellion\r\n",
      "against this inherited blot which had been thrust on his knowledge to\r\n",
      "reflect at present whether he had not been too hard on Bulstrode—too\r\n",
      "arrogantly merciless towards a man of sixty, who was making efforts at\r\n",
      "retrieval when time had rendered them vain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No third person listening could have thoroughly understood the\r\n",
      "impetuosity of Will’s repulse or the bitterness of his words. No one\r\n",
      "but himself then knew how everything connected with the sentiment of\r\n",
      "his own dignity had an immediate bearing for him on his relation to\r\n",
      "Dorothea and to Mr. Casaubon’s treatment of him. And in the rush of\r\n",
      "impulses by which he flung back that offer of Bulstrode’s there was\r\n",
      "mingled the sense that it would have been impossible for him ever to\r\n",
      "tell Dorothea that he had accepted it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Bulstrode—when Will was gone he suffered a violent reaction, and\r\n",
      "wept like a woman. It was the first time he had encountered an open\r\n",
      "expression of scorn from any man higher than Raffles; and with that\r\n",
      "scorn hurrying like venom through his system, there was no sensibility\r\n",
      "left to consolations. But the relief of weeping had to be checked. His\r\n",
      "wife and daughters soon came home from hearing the address of an\r\n",
      "Oriental missionary, and were full of regret that papa had not heard,\r\n",

      "repeat to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps, through all other hidden thoughts, the one that breathed most\r\n",

      "with Bulstrode he wrote a brief letter to her, saying that various\r\n",
      "causes had detained him in the neighborhood longer than he had\r\n",
      "expected, and asking her permission to call again at Lowick at some\r\n",
      "hour which she would mention on the earliest possible day, he being\r\n",
      "anxious to depart, but unwilling to do so until she had granted him an\r\n",

      "farewell has pathos in it, but to come back for a second lends an\r\n",
      "opening to comedy, and it was possible even that there might be bitter\r\n",
      "sneers afloat about Will’s motives for lingering. Still it was on the\r\n",
      "whole more satisfactory to his feeling to take the directest means of\r\n",
      "seeing Dorothea, than to use any device which might give an air of\r\n",
      "chance to a meeting of which he wished her to understand that it was\r\n",
      "what he earnestly sought. When he had parted from her before, he had\r\n",
      "been in ignorance of facts which gave a new aspect to the relation\r\n",
      "between them, and made a more absolute severance than he had then\r\n",
      "believed in. He knew nothing of Dorothea’s private fortune, and being\r\n",
      "little used to reflect on such matters, took it for granted that\r\n",
      "according to Mr. Casaubon’s arrangement marriage to him, Will Ladislaw,\r\n",
      "would mean that she consented to be penniless. That was not what he\r\n",
      "could wish for even in his secret heart, or even if she had been ready\r\n",
      "to meet such hard contrast for his sake. And then, too, there was the\r\n",
      "fresh smart of that disclosure about his mother’s family, which if\r\n",
      "known would be an added reason why Dorothea’s friends should look down\r\n",

      "might come back with the sense that he had at least a personal value\r\n",
      "equal to her wealth, seemed now the dreamy continuation of a dream.\r\n",
      "This change would surely justify him in asking Dorothea to receive him\r\n",
      "once more.\r\n",

      "consequence of a letter from her uncle announcing his intention to be\r\n",
      "at home in a week, she had driven first to Freshitt to carry the news,\r\n",
      "meaning to go on to the Grange to deliver some orders with which her\r\n",

      "are conditions under which the most majestic person is obliged to\r\n",
      "sneeze, and our emotions are liable to be acted on in the same\r\n",
      "incongruous manner. Good Sir James was this morning so far unlike\r\n",
      "himself that he was irritably anxious to say something to Dorothea on a\r\n",
      "subject which he usually avoided as if it had been a matter of shame to\r\n",
      "them both. He could not use Celia as a medium, because he did not\r\n",
      "choose that she should know the kind of gossip he had in his mind; and\r\n",
      "before Dorothea happened to arrive he had been trying to imagine how,\r\n",
      "with his shyness and unready tongue, he could ever manage to introduce\r\n",
      "his communication. Her unexpected presence brought him to utter\r\n",
      "hopelessness in his own power of saying anything unpleasant; but\r\n",
      "desperation suggested a resource; he sent the groom on an unsaddled\r\n",
      "horse across the park with a pencilled note to Mrs. Cadwallader, who\r\n",
      "already knew the gossip, and would think it no compromise of herself to\r\n",
      "repeat it as often as required.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was detained on the good pretext that Mr. Garth, whom she\r\n",
      "wanted to see, was expected at the hall within the hour, and she was\r\n",
      "still talking to Caleb on the gravel when Sir James, on the watch for\r\n",
      "the rector’s wife, saw her coming and met her with the needful hints.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Enough! I understand,”—said Mrs. Cadwallader. “You shall be innocent.\r\n",
      "I am such a blackamoor that I cannot smirch myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t mean that it’s of any consequence,” said Sir James, disliking\r\n",
      "that Mrs. Cadwallader should understand too much. “Only it is desirable\r\n",
      "that Dorothea should know there are reasons why she should not receive\r\n",
      "him again; and I really can’t say so to her. It will come lightly from\r\n",
      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It came very lightly indeed. When Dorothea quitted Caleb and turned to\r\n",
      "meet them, it appeared that Mrs. Cadwallader had stepped across the\r\n",
      "park by the merest chance in the world, just to chat with Celia in a\r\n",
      "matronly way about the baby. And so Mr. Brooke was coming back?\r\n",
      "Delightful!—coming back, it was to be hoped, quite cured of\r\n",
      "Parliamentary fever and pioneering. Apropos of the “Pioneer”—somebody\r\n",
      "had prophesied that it would soon be like a dying dolphin, and turn all\r\n",
      "colors for want of knowing how to help itself, because Mr. Brooke’s\r\n",
      "protege, the brilliant young Ladislaw, was gone or going. Had Sir James\r\n",
      "heard that?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The three were walking along the gravel slowly, and Sir James, turning\r\n",
      "aside to whip a shrub, said he had heard something of that sort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All false!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “He is not gone, or going,\r\n",
      "apparently; the ‘Pioneer’ keeps its color, and Mr. Orlando Ladislaw is\r\n",
      "making a sad dark-blue scandal by warbling continually with your Mr.\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s wife, who they tell me is as pretty as pretty can be. It\r\n",
      "seems nobody ever goes into the house without finding this young\r\n",
      "gentleman lying on the rug or warbling at the piano. But the people in\r\n",
      "manufacturing towns are always disreputable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You began by saying that one report was false, Mrs. Cadwallader, and I\r\n",
      "believe this is false too,” said Dorothea, with indignant energy; “at\r\n",
      "least, I feel sure it is a misrepresentation. I will not hear any evil\r\n",
      "spoken of Mr. Ladislaw; he has already suffered too much injustice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea when thoroughly moved cared little what any one thought of her\r\n",
      "feelings; and even if she had been able to reflect, she would have held\r\n",
      "it petty to keep silence at injurious words about Will from fear of\r\n",
      "being herself misunderstood. Her face was flushed and her lip trembled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James, glancing at her, repented of his stratagem; but Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader, equal to all occasions, spread the palms of her hands\r\n",
      "outward and said—“Heaven grant it, my dear!—I mean that all bad tales\r\n",
      "about anybody may be false. But it is a pity that young Lydgate should\r\n",
      "have married one of these Middlemarch girls. Considering he’s a son of\r\n",
      "somebody, he might have got a woman with good blood in her veins, and\r\n",
      "not too young, who would have put up with his profession. There’s Clara\r\n",
      "Harfager, for instance, whose friends don’t know what to do with her;\r\n",
      "and she has a portion. Then we might have had her among us.\r\n",
      "However!—it’s no use being wise for other people. Where is Celia? Pray\r\n",
      "let us go in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am going on immediately to Tipton,” said Dorothea, rather haughtily.\r\n",
      "“Good-by.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James could say nothing as he accompanied her to the carriage. He\r\n",
      "was altogether discontented with the result of a contrivance which had\r\n",
      "cost him some secret humiliation beforehand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea drove along between the berried hedgerows and the shorn\r\n",
      "corn-fields, not seeing or hearing anything around. The tears came and\r\n",
      "rolled down her cheeks, but she did not know it. The world, it seemed,\r\n",
      "was turning ugly and hateful, and there was no place for her\r\n",
      "trustfulness. “It is not true—it is not true!” was the voice within her\r\n",
      "that she listened to; but all the while a remembrance to which there\r\n",
      "had always clung a vague uneasiness would thrust itself on her\r\n",
      "attention—the remembrance of that day when she had found Will Ladislaw\r\n",
      "with Mrs. Lydgate, and had heard his voice accompanied by the piano.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He said he would never do anything that I disapproved—I wish I could\r\n",
      "have told him that I disapproved of that,” said poor Dorothea,\r\n",
      "inwardly, feeling a strange alternation between anger with Will and the\r\n",
      "passionate defence of him. “They all try to blacken him before me; but\r\n",
      "I will care for no pain, if he is not to blame. I always believed he\r\n",
      "was good.”—These were her last thoughts before she felt that the\r\n",
      "carriage was passing under the archway of the lodge-gate at the Grange,\r\n",
      "when she hurriedly pressed her handkerchief to her face and began to\r\n",
      "think of her errands. The coachman begged leave to take out the horses\r\n",
      "for half an hour as there was something wrong with a shoe; and\r\n",
      "Dorothea, having the sense that she was going to rest, took off her\r\n",
      "gloves and bonnet, while she was leaning against a statue in the\r\n",
      "entrance-hall, and talking to the housekeeper. At last she said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must stay here a little, Mrs. Kell. I will go into the library and\r\n",
      "write you some memoranda from my uncle’s letter, if you will open the\r\n",
      "shutters for me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The shutters are open, madam,” said Mrs. Kell, following Dorothea, who\r\n",
      "had walked along as she spoke. “Mr. Ladislaw is there, looking for\r\n",
      "something.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "(Will had come to fetch a portfolio of his own sketches which he had\r\n",
      "missed in the act of packing his movables, and did not choose to leave\r\n",
      "behind.)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s heart seemed to turn over as if it had had a blow, but she\r\n",
      "was not perceptibly checked: in truth, the sense that Will was there\r\n",
      "was for the moment all-satisfying to her, like the sight of something\r\n",
      "precious that one has lost. When she reached the door she said to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Kell—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go in first, and tell him that I am here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will had found his portfolio, and had laid it on the table at the far\r\n",
      "end of the room, to turn over the sketches and please himself by\r\n",
      "looking at the memorable piece of art which had a relation to nature\r\n",
      "too mysterious for Dorothea. He was smiling at it still, and shaking\r\n",
      "the sketches into order with the thought that he might find a letter\r\n",
      "from her awaiting him at Middlemarch, when Mrs. Kell close to his elbow\r\n",
      "said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Casaubon is coming in, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will turned round quickly, and the next moment Dorothea was entering.\r\n",
      "As Mrs. Kell closed the door behind her they met: each was looking at\r\n",
      "the other, and consciousness was overflowed by something that\r\n",
      "suppressed utterance. It was not confusion that kept them silent, for\r\n",
      "they both felt that parting was near, and there is no shamefacedness in\r\n",
      "a sad parting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She moved automatically towards her uncle’s chair against the\r\n",
      "writing-table, and Will, after drawing it out a little for her, went a\r\n",
      "few paces off and stood opposite to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray sit down,” said Dorothea, crossing her hands on her lap; “I am\r\n",
      "very glad you were here.” Will thought that her face looked just as it\r\n",
      "did when she first shook hands with him in Rome; for her widow’s cap,\r\n",
      "fixed in her bonnet, had gone off with it, and he could see that she\r\n",
      "had lately been shedding tears. But the mixture of anger in her\r\n",
      "agitation had vanished at the sight of him; she had been used, when\r\n",
      "they were face to face, always to feel confidence and the happy freedom\r\n",
      "which comes with mutual understanding, and how could other people’s\r\n",
      "words hinder that effect on a sudden? Let the music which can take\r\n",
      "possession of our frame and fill the air with joy for us, sound once\r\n",
      "more—what does it signify that we heard it found fault with in its\r\n",
      "absence?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have sent a letter to Lowick Manor to-day, asking leave to see you,”\r\n",
      "said Will, seating himself opposite to her. “I am going away\r\n",
      "immediately, and I could not go without speaking to you again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought we had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks ago—you\r\n",
      "thought you were going then,” said Dorothea, her voice trembling a\r\n",
      "little.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; but I was in ignorance then of things which I know now—things\r\n",
      "which have altered my feelings about the future. When I saw you before,\r\n",
      "I was dreaming that I might come back some day. I don’t think I ever\r\n",
      "shall—now.” Will paused here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You wished me to know the reasons?” said Dorothea, timidly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Will, impetuously, shaking his head backward, and looking\r\n",
      "away from her with irritation in his face. “Of course I must wish it. I\r\n",
      "have been grossly insulted in your eyes and in the eyes of others.\r\n",
      "There has been a mean implication against my character. I wish you to\r\n",
      "know that under no circumstances would I have lowered myself by—under\r\n",
      "no circumstances would I have given men the chance of saying that I\r\n",
      "sought money under the pretext of seeking—something else. There was no\r\n",
      "need of other safeguard against me—the safeguard of wealth was enough.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will rose from his chair with the last word and went—he hardly knew\r\n",
      "where; but it was to the projecting window nearest him, which had been\r\n",
      "open as now about the same season a year ago, when he and Dorothea had\r\n",
      "stood within it and talked together. Her whole heart was going out at\r\n",
      "this moment in sympathy with Will’s indignation: she only wanted to\r\n",
      "convince him that she had never done him injustice, and he seemed to\r\n",
      "have turned away from her as if she too had been part of the unfriendly\r\n",
      "world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would be very unkind of you to suppose that I ever attributed any\r\n",
      "meanness to you,” she began. Then in her ardent way, wanting to plead\r\n",
      "with him, she moved from her chair and went in front of him to her old\r\n",
      "place in the window, saying, “Do you suppose that I ever disbelieved in\r\n",
      "you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Will saw her there, he gave a start and moved backward out of the\r\n",
      "window, without meeting her glance. Dorothea was hurt by this movement\r\n",
      "following up the previous anger of his tone. She was ready to say that\r\n",
      "it was as hard on her as on him, and that she was helpless; but those\r\n",
      "strange particulars of their relation which neither of them could\r\n",
      "explicitly mention kept her always in dread of saying too much. At this\r\n",
      "moment she had no belief that Will would in any case have wanted to\r\n",
      "marry her, and she feared using words which might imply such a belief.\r\n",
      "She only said earnestly, recurring to his last word—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure no safeguard was ever needed against you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will did not answer. In the stormy fluctuation of his feelings these\r\n",
      "words of hers seemed to him cruelly neutral, and he looked pale and\r\n",
      "miserable after his angry outburst. He went to the table and fastened\r\n",
      "up his portfolio, while Dorothea looked at him from the distance. They\r\n",
      "were wasting these last moments together in wretched silence. What\r\n",
      "could he say, since what had got obstinately uppermost in his mind was\r\n",
      "the passionate love for her which he forbade himself to utter? What\r\n",
      "could she say, since she might offer him no help—since she was forced\r\n",
      "to keep the money that ought to have been his?—since to-day he seemed\r\n",
      "not to respond as he used to do to her thorough trust and liking?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Will at last turned away from his portfolio and approached the\r\n",
      "window again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must go,” he said, with that peculiar look of the eyes which\r\n",
      "sometimes accompanies bitter feeling, as if they had been tired and\r\n",
      "burned with gazing too close at a light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What shall you do in life?” said Dorothea, timidly. “Have your\r\n",
      "intentions remained just the same as when we said good-by before?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Will, in a tone that seemed to waive the subject as\r\n",
      "uninteresting. “I shall work away at the first thing that offers. I\r\n",
      "suppose one gets a habit of doing without happiness or hope.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, what sad words!” said Dorothea, with a dangerous tendency to sob.\r\n",
      "Then trying to smile, she added, “We used to agree that we were alike\r\n",
      "in speaking too strongly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have not spoken too strongly now,” said Will, leaning back against\r\n",
      "the angle of the wall. “There are certain things which a man can only\r\n",
      "go through once in his life; and he must know some time or other that\r\n",
      "the best is over with him. This experience has happened to me while I\r\n",
      "am very young—that is all. What I care more for than I can ever care\r\n",
      "for anything else is absolutely forbidden to me—I don’t mean merely by\r\n",
      "being out of my reach, but forbidden me, even if it were within my\r\n",
      "reach, by my own pride and honor—by everything I respect myself for. Of\r\n",
      "course I shall go on living as a man might do who had seen heaven in a\r\n",
      "trance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will paused, imagining that it would be impossible for Dorothea to\r\n",
      "misunderstand this; indeed he felt that he was contradicting himself\r\n",
      "and offending against his self-approval in speaking to her so plainly;\r\n",
      "but still—it could not be fairly called wooing a woman to tell her that\r\n",
      "he would never woo her. It must be admitted to be a ghostly kind of\r\n",
      "wooing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Dorothea’s mind was rapidly going over the past with quite another\r\n",
      "vision than his. The thought that she herself might be what Will most\r\n",
      "cared for did throb through her an instant, but then came doubt: the\r\n",
      "memory of the little they had lived through together turned pale and\r\n",
      "shrank before the memory which suggested how much fuller might have\r\n",
      "been the intercourse between Will and some one else with whom he had\r\n",
      "had constant companionship. Everything he had said might refer to that\r\n",
      "other relation, and whatever had passed between him and herself was\r\n",
      "thoroughly explained by what she had always regarded as their simple\r\n",
      "friendship and the cruel obstruction thrust upon it by her husband’s\r\n",
      "injurious act. Dorothea stood silent, with her eyes cast down dreamily,\r\n",
      "while images crowded upon her which left the sickening certainty that\r\n",
      "Will was referring to Mrs. Lydgate. But why sickening? He wanted her to\r\n",
      "know that here too his conduct should be above suspicion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was not surprised at her silence. His mind also was tumultuously\r\n",
      "busy while he watched her, and he was feeling rather wildly that\r\n",
      "something must happen to hinder their parting—some miracle, clearly\r\n",
      "nothing in their own deliberate speech. Yet, after all, had she any\r\n",
      "love for him?—he could not pretend to himself that he would rather\r\n",
      "believe her to be without that pain. He could not deny that a secret\r\n",
      "longing for the assurance that she loved him was at the root of all his\r\n",
      "words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Neither of them knew how long they stood in that way. Dorothea was\r\n",
      "raising her eyes, and was about to speak, when the door opened and her\r\n",
      "footman came to say—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The horses are ready, madam, whenever you like to start.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Presently,” said Dorothea. Then turning to Will, she said, “I have\r\n",
      "some memoranda to write for the housekeeper.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must go,” said Will, when the door had closed again—advancing\r\n",
      "towards her. “The day after to-morrow I shall leave Middlemarch.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have acted in every way rightly,” said Dorothea, in a low tone,\r\n",
      "feeling a pressure at her heart which made it difficult to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She put out her hand, and Will took it for an instant without speaking,\r\n",
      "for her words had seemed to him cruelly cold and unlike herself. Their\r\n",
      "eyes met, but there was discontent in his, and in hers there was only\r\n",
      "sadness. He turned away and took his portfolio under his arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have never done you injustice. Please remember me,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "repressing a rising sob.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should you say that?” said Will, with irritation. “As if I were\r\n",
      "not in danger of forgetting everything else.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had really a movement of anger against her at that moment, and it\r\n",
      "impelled him to go away without pause. It was all one flash to\r\n",
      "Dorothea—his last words—his distant bow to her as he reached the\r\n",
      "door—the sense that he was no longer there. She sank into the chair,\r\n",
      "and for a few moments sat like a statue, while images and emotions were\r\n",
      "hurrying upon her. Joy came first, in spite of the threatening train\r\n",
      "behind it—joy in the impression that it was really herself whom Will\r\n",
      "loved and was renouncing, that there was really no other love less\r\n",
      "permissible, more blameworthy, which honor was hurrying him away from.\r\n",
      "They were parted all the same, but—Dorothea drew a deep breath and felt\r\n",
      "her strength return—she could think of him unrestrainedly. At that\r\n",
      "moment the parting was easy to bear: the first sense of loving and\r\n",
      "being loved excluded sorrow. It was as if some hard icy pressure had\r\n",
      "melted, and her consciousness had room to expand: her past was come\r\n",
      "back to her with larger interpretation. The joy was not the\r\n",
      "less—perhaps it was the more complete just then—because of the\r\n",
      "irrevocable parting; for there was no reproach, no contemptuous wonder\r\n",
      "to imagine in any eye or from any lips. He had acted so as to defy\r\n",
      "reproach, and make wonder respectful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Any one watching her might have seen that there was a fortifying\r\n",
      "thought within her. Just as when inventive power is working with glad\r\n",
      "ease some small claim on the attention is fully met as if it were only\r\n",
      "a cranny opened to the sunlight, it was easy now for Dorothea to write\r\n",
      "her memoranda. She spoke her last words to the housekeeper in cheerful\r\n",
      "tones, and when she seated herself in the carriage her eyes were bright\r\n",
      "and her cheeks blooming under the dismal bonnet. She threw back the\r\n",
      "heavy “weepers,” and looked before her, wondering which road Will had\r\n",
      "taken. It was in her nature to be proud that he was blameless, and\r\n",
      "through all her feelings there ran this vein—“I was right to defend\r\n",
      "him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The coachman was used to drive his grays at a good pace, Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "being unenjoying and impatient in everything away from his desk, and\r\n",
      "wanting to get to the end of all journeys; and Dorothea was now bowled\r\n",
      "along quickly. Driving was pleasant, for rain in the night had laid the\r\n",
      "dust, and the blue sky looked far off, away from the region of the\r\n",
      "great clouds that sailed in masses. The earth looked like a happy place\r\n",
      "under the vast heavens, and Dorothea was wishing that she might\r\n",
      "overtake Will and see him once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a turn of the road, there he was with the portfolio under his\r\n",
      "arm; but the next moment she was passing him while he raised his hat,\r\n",
      "and she felt a pang at being seated there in a sort of exaltation,\r\n",
      "leaving him behind. She could not look back at him. It was as if a\r\n",
      "crowd of indifferent objects had thrust them asunder, and forced them\r\n",
      "along different paths, taking them farther and farther away from each\r\n",
      "other, and making it useless to look back. She could no more make any\r\n",
      "sign that would seem to say, “Need we part?” than she could stop the\r\n",
      "carriage to wait for him. Nay, what a world of reasons crowded upon her\r\n",
      "against any movement of her thought towards a future that might reverse\r\n",
      "the decision of this day!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I only wish I had known before—I wish he knew—then we could be quite\r\n",
      "happy in thinking of each other, though we are forever parted. And if I\r\n",
      "could but have given him the money, and made things easier for\r\n",
      "him!”—were the longings that came back the most persistently. And yet,\r\n",
      "so heavily did the world weigh on her in spite of her independent\r\n",
      "energy, that with this idea of Will as in need of such help and at a\r\n",
      "disadvantage with the world, there came always the vision of that\r\n",
      "unfittingness of any closer relation between them which lay in the\r\n",
      "opinion of every one connected with her. She felt to the full all the\r\n",
      "imperativeness of the motives which urged Will’s conduct. How could he\r\n",
      "dream of her defying the barrier that her husband had placed between\r\n",
      "them?—how could she ever say to herself that she would defy it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will’s certainty as the carriage grew smaller in the distance, had much\r\n",
      "more bitterness in it. Very slight matters were enough to gall him in\r\n",
      "his sensitive mood, and the sight of Dorothea driving past him while he\r\n",
      "felt himself plodding along as a poor devil seeking a position in a\r\n",
      "world which in his present temper offered him little that he coveted,\r\n",
      "made his conduct seem a mere matter of necessity, and took away the\r\n",
      "sustainment of resolve. After all, he had no assurance that she loved\r\n",
      "him: could any man pretend that he was simply glad in such a case to\r\n",
      "have the suffering all on his own side?\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This was not the first time that Mr. Farebrother had heard hints of\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s expenses being obviously too great to be met by his practice,\r\n",

      "go to Middlemarch on purpose to have a chat with Lydgate as of old, he\r\n",
      "noticed in him an air of excited effort quite unlike his usual easy way\r\n",
      "of keeping silence or breaking it with abrupt energy whenever he had\r\n",
      "anything to say. Lydgate talked persistently when they were in his\r\n",
      "work-room, putting arguments for and against the probability of certain\r\n",
      "biological views; but he had none of those definite things to say or to\r\n",
      "show which give the waymarks of a patient uninterrupted pursuit, such\r\n",
      "as he used himself to insist on, saying that “there must be a systole\r\n",
      "and diastole in all inquiry,” and that “a man’s mind must be\r\n",
      "continually expanding and shrinking between the whole human horizon and\r\n",
      "the horizon of an object-glass.” That evening he seemed to be talking\r\n",
      "widely for the sake of resisting any personal bearing; and before long\r\n",
      "they went into the drawing room, where Lydgate, having asked Rosamond\r\n",
      "to give them music, sank back in his chair in silence, but with a\r\n",
      "strange light in his eyes. “He may have been taking an opiate,” was a\r\n",
      "thought that crossed Mr. Farebrother’s mind—“tic-douloureux perhaps—or\r\n",
      "medical worries.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It did not occur to him that Lydgate’s marriage was not delightful: he\r\n",
      "believed, as the rest did, that Rosamond was an amiable, docile\r\n",
      "creature, though he had always thought her rather uninteresting—a\r\n",
      "little too much the pattern-card of the finishing-school; and his\r\n",
      "mother could not forgive Rosamond because she never seemed to see that\r\n",
      "Henrietta Noble was in the room. “However, Lydgate fell in love with\r\n",
      "her,” said the Vicar to himself, “and she must be to his taste.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very\r\n",
      "little corresponding fibre in himself, and perhaps too little care\r\n",
      "about personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or\r\n",
      "foolish, he could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate\r\n",
      "shrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his\r\n",
      "private affairs. And soon after that conversation at Mr. Toller’s, the\r\n",
      "Vicar learned something which made him watch the more eagerly for an\r\n",
      "opportunity of indirectly letting Lydgate know that if he wanted to\r\n",
      "open himself about any difficulty there was a friendly ear ready.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The opportunity came at Mr. Vincy’s, where, on New Year’s Day, there\r\n",
      "was a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited, on the\r\n",
      "plea that he must not forsake his old friends on the first new year of\r\n",
      "his being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar. And this party\r\n",
      "was thoroughly friendly: all the ladies of the Farebrother family were\r\n",
      "present; the Vincy children all dined at the table, and Fred had\r\n",
      "persuaded his mother that if she did not invite Mary Garth, the\r\n",
      "Farebrothers would regard it as a slight to themselves, Mary being\r\n",
      "their particular friend. Mary came, and Fred was in high spirits,\r\n",
      "though his enjoyment was of a checkered kind—triumph that his mother\r\n",
      "should see Mary’s importance with the chief personages in the party\r\n",
      "being much streaked with jealousy when Mr. Farebrother sat down by her.\r\n",
      "Fred used to be much more easy about his own accomplishments in the\r\n",
      "days when he had not begun to dread being “bowled out by Farebrother,”\r\n",
      "and this terror was still before him. Mrs. Vincy, in her fullest\r\n",
      "matronly bloom, looked at Mary’s little figure, rough wavy hair, and\r\n",
      "visage quite without lilies and roses, and wondered; trying\r\n",
      "unsuccessfully to fancy herself caring about Mary’s appearance in\r\n",
      "wedding clothes, or feeling complacency in grandchildren who would\r\n",
      "“feature” the Garths. However, the party was a merry one, and Mary was\r\n",
      "particularly bright; being glad, for Fred’s sake, that his friends were\r\n",
      "getting kinder to her, and being also quite willing that they should\r\n",
      "see how much she was valued by others whom they must admit to be\r\n",
      "judges.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Farebrother noticed that Lydgate seemed bored, and that Mr. Vincy\r\n",
      "spoke as little as possible to his son-in-law. Rosamond was perfectly\r\n",
      "graceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had\r\n",
      "not been roused to bestow on her would have perceived the total absence\r\n",
      "of that interest in her husband’s presence which a loving wife is sure\r\n",
      "to betray, even if etiquette keeps her aloof from him. When Lydgate was\r\n",
      "taking part in the conversation, she never looked towards him any more\r\n",
      "than if she had been a sculptured Psyche modelled to look another way:\r\n",
      "and when, after being called out for an hour or two, he re-entered the\r\n",
      "room, she seemed unconscious of the fact, which eighteen months before\r\n",
      "would have had the effect of a numeral before ciphers. In reality,\r\n",
      "however, she was intensely aware of Lydgate’s voice and movements; and\r\n",
      "her pretty good-tempered air of unconsciousness was a studied negation\r\n",
      "by which she satisfied her inward opposition to him without compromise\r\n",
      "of propriety. When the ladies were in the drawing-room after Lydgate\r\n",
      "had been called away from the dessert, Mrs. Farebrother, when Rosamond\r\n",
      "happened to be near her, said—“You have to give up a great deal of your\r\n",
      "husband’s society, Mrs. Lydgate.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, the life of a medical man is very arduous: especially when he is\r\n",
      "so devoted to his profession as Mr. Lydgate is,” said Rosamond, who was\r\n",
      "standing, and moved easily away at the end of this correct little\r\n",
      "speech.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is dreadfully dull for her when there is no company,” said Mrs.\r\n",
      "Vincy, who was seated at the old lady’s side. “I am sure I thought so\r\n",
      "when Rosamond was ill, and I was staying with her. You know, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Farebrother, ours is a cheerful house. I am of a cheerful disposition\r\n",
      "myself, and Mr. Vincy always likes something to be going on. That is\r\n",
      "what Rosamond has been used to. Very different from a husband out at\r\n",
      "odd hours, and never knowing when he will come home, and of a close,\r\n",
      "proud disposition, _I_ think”—indiscreet Mrs. Vincy did lower her tone\r\n",
      "slightly with this parenthesis. “But Rosamond always had an angel of a\r\n",
      "temper; her brothers used very often not to please her, but she was\r\n",
      "never the girl to show temper; from a baby she was always as good as\r\n",
      "good, and with a complexion beyond anything. But my children are all\r\n",
      "good-tempered, thank God.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was easily credible to any one looking at Mrs. Vincy as she threw\r\n",
      "back her broad cap-strings, and smiled towards her three little girls,\r\n",
      "aged from seven to eleven. But in that smiling glance she was obliged\r\n",
      "to include Mary Garth, whom the three girls had got into a corner to\r\n",
      "make her tell them stories. Mary was just finishing the delicious tale\r\n",
      "of Rumpelstiltskin, which she had well by heart, because Letty was\r\n",
      "never tired of communicating it to her ignorant elders from a favorite\r\n",
      "red volume. Louisa, Mrs. Vincy’s darling, now ran to her with wide-eyed\r\n",
      "serious excitement, crying, “Oh mamma, mamma, the little man stamped so\r\n",
      "hard on the floor he couldn’t get his leg out again!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bless you, my cherub!” said mamma; “you shall tell me all about it\r\n",
      "to-morrow. Go and listen!” and then, as her eyes followed Louisa back\r\n",
      "towards the attractive corner, she thought that if Fred wished her to\r\n",
      "invite Mary again she would make no objection, the children being so\r\n",
      "pleased with her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But presently the corner became still more animated, for Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother came in, and seating himself behind Louisa, took her on his\r\n",
      "lap; whereupon the girls all insisted that he must hear\r\n",
      "Rumpelstiltskin, and Mary must tell it over again. He insisted too, and\r\n",
      "Mary, without fuss, began again in her neat fashion, with precisely the\r\n",
      "same words as before. Fred, who had also seated himself near, would\r\n",
      "have felt unmixed triumph in Mary’s effectiveness if Mr. Farebrother\r\n",
      "had not been looking at her with evident admiration, while he\r\n",
      "dramatized an intense interest in the tale to please the children.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will never care any more about my one-eyed giant, Loo,” said Fred\r\n",
      "at the end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I shall. Tell about him now,” said Louisa.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I dare say; I am quite cut out. Ask Mr. Farebrother.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” added Mary; “ask Mr. Farebrother to tell you about the ants\r\n",
      "whose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom, and he\r\n",
      "thought they didn’t mind because he couldn’t hear them cry, or see them\r\n",
      "use their pocket-handkerchiefs.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Please,” said Louisa, looking up at the Vicar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, I am a grave old parson. If I try to draw a story out of my\r\n",
      "bag a sermon comes instead. Shall I preach you a sermon?” said he,\r\n",
      "putting on his short-sighted glasses, and pursing up his lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Louisa, falteringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me see, then. Against cakes: how cakes are bad things, especially\r\n",
      "if they are sweet and have plums in them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Louisa took the affair rather seriously, and got down from the Vicar’s\r\n",
      "knee to go to Fred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, I see it will not do to preach on New Year’s Day,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother, rising and walking away. He had discovered of late that\r\n",
      "Fred had become jealous of him, and also that he himself was not losing\r\n",
      "his preference for Mary above all other women.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A delightful young person is Miss Garth,” said Mrs. Farebrother, who\r\n",
      "had been watching her son’s movements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mrs. Vincy, obliged to reply, as the old lady turned to her\r\n",
      "expectantly. “It is a pity she is not better-looking.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot say that,” said Mrs. Farebrother, decisively. “I like her\r\n",
      "countenance. We must not always ask for beauty, when a good God has\r\n",
      "seen fit to make an excellent young woman without it. I put good\r\n",
      "manners first, and Miss Garth will know how to conduct herself in any\r\n",
      "station.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old lady was a little sharp in her tone, having a prospective\r\n",
      "reference to Mary’s becoming her daughter-in-law; for there was this\r\n",
      "inconvenience in Mary’s position with regard to Fred, that it was not\r\n",
      "suitable to be made public, and hence the three ladies at Lowick\r\n",
      "Parsonage were still hoping that Camden would choose Miss Garth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "New visitors entered, and the drawing-room was given up to music and\r\n",
      "games, while whist-tables were prepared in the quiet room on the other\r\n",
      "side of the hall. Mr. Farebrother played a rubber to satisfy his\r\n",
      "mother, who regarded her occasional whist as a protest against scandal\r\n",
      "and novelty of opinion, in which light even a revoke had its dignity.\r\n",
      "But at the end he got Mr. Chichely to take his place, and left the\r\n",
      "room. As he crossed the hall, Lydgate had just come in and was taking\r\n",
      "off his great-coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are the man I was going to look for,” said the Vicar; and instead\r\n",
      "of entering the drawing-room, they walked along the hall and stood\r\n",
      "against the fireplace, where the frosty air helped to make a glowing\r\n",
      "bank. “You see, I can leave the whist-table easily enough,” he went on,\r\n",
      "smiling at Lydgate, “now I don’t play for money. I owe that to you,\r\n",
      "Mrs. Casaubon says.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How?” said Lydgate, coldly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, you didn’t mean me to know it; I call that ungenerous reticence.\r\n",
      "You should let a man have the pleasure of feeling that you have done\r\n",
      "him a good turn. I don’t enter into some people’s dislike of being\r\n",
      "under an obligation: upon my word, I prefer being under an obligation\r\n",
      "to everybody for behaving well to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can’t tell what you mean,” said Lydgate, “unless it is that I once\r\n",
      "spoke of you to Mrs. Casaubon. But I did not think that she would break\r\n",
      "her promise not to mention that I had done so,” said Lydgate, leaning\r\n",
      "his back against the corner of the mantel-piece, and showing no\r\n",
      "radiance in his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was Brooke who let it out, only the other day. He paid me the\r\n",
      "compliment of saying that he was very glad I had the living though you\r\n",

      "It was because Lydgate writhed under the idea of getting his neck\r\n",
      "beneath this vile yoke that he had fallen into a bitter moody state\r\n",

      "the first disclosure about the bill of sale, he had made many efforts\r\n",
      "to draw her into sympathy with him about possible measures for\r\n",
      "narrowing their expenses, and with the threatening approach of\r\n",
      "Christmas his propositions grew more and more definite. “We two can do\r\n",
      "with only one servant, and live on very little,” he said, “and I shall\r\n",
      "manage with one horse.” For Lydgate, as we have seen, had begun to\r\n",
      "reason, with a more distinct vision, about the expenses of living, and\r\n",
      "any share of pride he had given to appearances of that sort was meagre\r\n",

      "division between them. Rosamond obeyed him, and he took her on his\r\n",
      "knee, but in her secret soul she was utterly aloof from him. The poor\r\n",
      "thing saw only that the world was not ordered to her liking, and\r\n",
      "Lydgate was part of that world. But he held her waist with one hand and\r\n",
      "laid the other gently on both of hers; for this rather abrupt man had\r\n",
      "much tenderness in his manners towards women, seeming to have always\r\n",
      "present in his imagination the weakness of their frames and the\r\n",

      "there must be many in our rank who manage with much less: they must do\r\n",
      "with commoner things, I suppose, and look after the scraps. It seems,\r\n",
      "money goes but a little way in these matters, for Wrench has everything\r\n",
      "as plain as possible, and he has a very large practice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, if you think of living as the Wrenches do!” said Rosamond, with a\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "several good houses. It cannot answer to be eccentric; you should think\r\n",

      "waternixie’s soul may have a charm until she becomes didactic. But he\r\n",
      "controlled himself, and only said, with a touch of despotic firmness—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What I am to do in my practice, Rosy, it is for me to judge. That is\r\n",
      "not the question between us. It is enough for you to know that our\r\n",
      "income is likely to be a very narrow one—hardly four hundred, perhaps\r\n",
      "less, for a long time to come, and we must try to re-arrange our lives\r\n",
      "in accordance with that fact.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond was silent for a moment or two, looking before her, and then\r\n",
      "said, “My uncle Bulstrode ought to allow you a salary for the time you\r\n",
      "give to the Hospital: it is not right that you should work for\r\n",
      "nothing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was understood from the beginning that my services would be\r\n",
      "gratuitous. That, again, need not enter into our discussion. I have\r\n",
      "pointed out what is the only probability,” said Lydgate, impatiently.\r\n",
      "Then checking himself, he went on more quietly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think I see one resource which would free us from a good deal of the\r\n",
      "present difficulty. I hear that young Ned Plymdale is going to be\r\n",
      "married to Miss Sophy Toller. They are rich, and it is not often that a\r\n",
      "good house is vacant in Middlemarch. I feel sure that they would be\r\n",
      "glad to take this house from us with most of our furniture, and they\r\n",
      "would be willing to pay handsomely for the lease. I can employ Trumbull\r\n",
      "to speak to Plymdale about it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond left her husband’s knee and walked slowly to the other end of\r\n",
      "the room; when she turned round and walked towards him it was evident\r\n",
      "that the tears had come, and that she was biting her under-lip and\r\n",
      "clasping her hands to keep herself from crying. Lydgate was\r\n",
      "wretched—shaken with anger and yet feeling that it would be unmanly to\r\n",
      "vent the anger just now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very sorry, Rosamond; I know this is painful.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought, at least, when I had borne to send the plate back and have\r\n",
      "that man taking an inventory of the furniture—I should have thought\r\n",
      "_that_ would suffice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I explained it to you at the time, dear. That was only a security and\r\n",
      "behind that security there is a debt. And that debt must be paid within\r\n",
      "the next few months, else we shall have our furniture sold. If young\r\n",
      "Plymdale will take our house and most of our furniture, we shall be\r\n",
      "able to pay that debt, and some others too, and we shall be quit of a\r\n",
      "place too expensive for us. We might take a smaller house: Trumbull, I\r\n",
      "know, has a very decent one to let at thirty pounds a-year, and this is\r\n",
      "ninety.” Lydgate uttered this speech in the curt hammering way with\r\n",
      "which we usually try to nail down a vague mind to imperative facts.\r\n",
      "Tears rolled silently down Rosamond’s cheeks; she just pressed her\r\n",
      "handkerchief against them, and stood looking at the large vase on the\r\n",
      "mantel-piece. It was a moment of more intense bitterness than she had\r\n",
      "ever felt before. At last she said, without hurry and with careful\r\n",
      "emphasis—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I never could have believed that you would like to act in that way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Like it?” burst out Lydgate, rising from his chair, thrusting his\r\n",
      "hands in his pockets and stalking away from the hearth; “it’s not a\r\n",
      "question of liking. Of course, I don’t like it; it’s the only thing I\r\n",
      "can do.” He wheeled round there, and turned towards her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should have thought there were many other means than that,” said\r\n",
      "Rosamond. “Let us have a sale and leave Middlemarch altogether.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To do what? What is the use of my leaving my work in Middlemarch to go\r\n",
      "where I have none? We should be just as penniless elsewhere as we are\r\n",
      "here,” said Lydgate still more angrily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If we are to be in that position it will be entirely your own doing,\r\n",
      "Tertius,” said Rosamond, turning round to speak with the fullest\r\n",
      "conviction. “You will not behave as you ought to do to your own family.\r\n",
      "You offended Captain Lydgate. Sir Godwin was very kind to me when we\r\n",
      "were at Quallingham, and I am sure if you showed proper regard to him\r\n",
      "and told him your affairs, he would do anything for you. But rather\r\n",
      "than that, you like giving up our house and furniture to Mr. Ned\r\n",
      "Plymdale.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was something like fierceness in Lydgate’s eyes, as he answered\r\n",
      "with new violence, “Well, then, if you will have it so, I do like it. I\r\n",
      "admit that I like it better than making a fool of myself by going to\r\n",
      "beg where it’s of no use. Understand then, that it is what I _like to\r\n",
      "do._”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a tone in the last sentence which was equivalent to the\r\n",
      "clutch of his strong hand on Rosamond’s delicate arm. But for all that,\r\n",
      "his will was not a whit stronger than hers. She immediately walked out\r\n",
      "of the room in silence, but with an intense determination to hinder\r\n",
      "what Lydgate liked to do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went out of the house, but as his blood cooled he felt that the\r\n",
      "chief result of the discussion was a deposit of dread within him at the\r\n",
      "idea of opening with his wife in future subjects which might again urge\r\n",
      "him to violent speech. It was as if a fracture in delicate crystal had\r\n",
      "begun, and he was afraid of any movement that might make it fatal. His\r\n",
      "marriage would be a mere piece of bitter irony if they could not go on\r\n",
      "loving each other. He had long ago made up his mind to what he thought\r\n",
      "was her negative character—her want of sensibility, which showed itself\r\n",
      "in disregard both of his specific wishes and of his general aims. The\r\n",
      "first great disappointment had been borne: the tender devotedness and\r\n",
      "docile adoration of the ideal wife must be renounced, and life must be\r\n",
      "taken up on a lower stage of expectation, as it is by men who have lost\r\n",
      "their limbs. But the real wife had not only her claims, she had still a\r\n",
      "hold on his heart, and it was his intense desire that the hold should\r\n",
      "remain strong. In marriage, the certainty, “She will never love me\r\n",
      "much,” is easier to bear than the fear, “I shall love her no more.”\r\n",
      "Hence, after that outburst, his inward effort was entirely to excuse\r\n",
      "her, and to blame the hard circumstances which were partly his fault.\r\n",
      "He tried that evening, by petting her, to heal the wound he had made in\r\n",
      "the morning, and it was not in Rosamond’s nature to be repellent or\r\n",
      "sulky; indeed, she welcomed the signs that her husband loved her and\r\n",
      "was under control. But this was something quite distinct from loving\r\n",
      "_him_. Lydgate would not have chosen soon to recur to the plan of\r\n",
      "parting with the house; he was resolved to carry it out, and say as\r\n",
      "little more about it as possible. But Rosamond herself touched on it at\r\n",
      "breakfast by saying, mildly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you spoken to Trumbull yet?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Lydgate, “but I shall call on him as I go by this morning.\r\n",
      "No time must be lost.” He took Rosamond’s question as a sign that she\r\n",
      "withdrew her inward opposition, and kissed her head caressingly when he\r\n",
      "got up to go away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as it was late enough to make a call, Rosamond went to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Plymdale, Mr. Ned’s mother, and entered with pretty congratulations\r\n",
      "into the subject of the coming marriage. Mrs. Plymdale’s maternal view\r\n",
      "was, that Rosamond might possibly now have retrospective glimpses of\r\n",
      "her own folly; and feeling the advantages to be at present all on the\r\n",
      "side of her son, was too kind a woman not to behave graciously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Ned is most happy, I must say. And Sophy Toller is all I could\r\n",
      "desire in a daughter-in-law. Of course her father is able to do\r\n",
      "something handsome for her—that is only what would be expected with a\r\n",
      "brewery like his. And the connection is everything we should desire.\r\n",
      "But that is not what I look at. She is such a very nice girl—no airs,\r\n",
      "no pretensions, though on a level with the first. I don’t mean with the\r\n",
      "titled aristocracy. I see very little good in people aiming out of\r\n",
      "their own sphere. I mean that Sophy is equal to the best in the town,\r\n",
      "and she is contented with that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have always thought her very agreeable,” said Rosamond.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I look upon it as a reward for Ned, who never held his head too high,\r\n",
      "that he should have got into the very best connection,” continued Mrs.\r\n",
      "Plymdale, her native sharpness softened by a fervid sense that she was\r\n",
      "taking a correct view. “And such particular people as the Tollers are,\r\n",
      "they might have objected because some of our friends are not theirs. It\r\n",
      "is well known that your aunt Bulstrode and I have been intimate from\r\n",
      "our youth, and Mr. Plymdale has been always on Mr. Bulstrode’s side.\r\n",

      "wholesome corrections.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, he has not the style of a captain in the army, or that sort of\r\n",
      "carriage as if everybody was beneath him, or that showy kind of\r\n",
      "talking, and singing, and intellectual talent. But I am thankful he has\r\n",
      "not. It is a poor preparation both for here and Hereafter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh dear, yes; appearances have very little to do with happiness,” said\r\n",

      "it belongs to him, and he is putting it nicely in repair. I suppose\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond had not foreseen that question and answer in setting out to\r\n",
      "pay her visit; she had simply meant to gather any information which\r\n",
      "would help her to avert the parting with her own house under\r\n",
      "circumstances thoroughly disagreeable to her. As to the untruth in her\r\n",
      "reply, she no more reflected on it than she did on the untruth there\r\n",
      "was in her saying that appearances had very little to do with\r\n",
      "happiness. Her object, she was convinced, was thoroughly justifiable:\r\n",
      "it was Lydgate whose intention was inexcusable; and there was a plan in\r\n",
      "her mind which, when she had carried it out fully, would prove how very\r\n",
      "false a step it would have been for him to have descended from his\r\n",
      "position.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She returned home by Mr. Borthrop Trumbull’s office, meaning to call\r\n",
      "there. It was the first time in her life that Rosamond had thought of\r\n",
      "doing anything in the form of business, but she felt equal to the\r\n",
      "occasion. That she should be obliged to do what she intensely disliked,\r\n",
      "was an idea which turned her quiet tenacity into active invention. Here\r\n",
      "was a case in which it could not be enough simply to disobey and be\r\n",
      "serenely, placidly obstinate: she must act according to her judgment,\r\n",
      "and she said to herself that her judgment was right—“indeed, if it had\r\n",
      "not been, she would not have wished to act on it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Trumbull was in the back-room of his office, and received Rosamond\r\n",
      "with his finest manners, not only because he had much sensibility to\r\n",
      "her charms, but because the good-natured fibre in him was stirred by\r\n",
      "his certainty that Lydgate was in difficulties, and that this\r\n",
      "uncommonly pretty woman—this young lady with the highest personal\r\n",
      "attractions—was likely to feel the pinch of trouble—to find herself\r\n",
      "involved in circumstances beyond her control. He begged her to do him\r\n",
      "the honor to take a seat, and stood before her trimming and comporting\r\n",
      "himself with an eager solicitude, which was chiefly benevolent.\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s first question was, whether her husband had called on Mr.\r\n",
      "Trumbull that morning, to speak about disposing of their house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am, yes, he did; he did so,” said the good auctioneer, trying\r\n",
      "to throw something soothing into his iteration. “I was about to fulfil\r\n",
      "his order, if possible, this afternoon. He wished me not to\r\n",
      "procrastinate.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I called to tell you not to go any further, Mr. Trumbull; and I beg of\r\n",

      "me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly I will, Mrs. Lydgate, certainly. Confidence is sacred with\r\n",
      "me on business or any other topic. I am then to consider the commission\r\n",
      "withdrawn?” said Mr. Trumbull, adjusting the long ends of his blue\r\n",
      "cravat with both hands, and looking at Rosamond deferentially.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, if you please. I find that Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house—the\r\n",
      "one in St. Peter’s Place next to Mr. Hackbutt’s. Mr. Lydgate would be\r\n",
      "annoyed that his orders should be fulfilled uselessly. And besides\r\n",
      "that, there are other circumstances which render the proposal\r\n",
      "unnecessary.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very good, Mrs. Lydgate, very good. I am at your commands, whenever\r\n",
      "you require any service of me,” said Mr. Trumbull, who felt pleasure in\r\n",
      "conjecturing that some new resources had been opened. “Rely on me, I\r\n",
      "beg. The affair shall go no further.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That evening Lydgate was a little comforted by observing that Rosamond\r\n",
      "was more lively than she had usually been of late, and even seemed\r\n",
      "interested in doing what would please him without being asked. He\r\n",
      "thought, “If she will be happy and I can rub through, what does it all\r\n",
      "signify? It is only a narrow swamp that we have to pass in a long\r\n",
      "journey. If I can get my mind clear again, I shall do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was so much cheered that he began to search for an account of\r\n",
      "experiments which he had long ago meant to look up, and had neglected\r\n",
      "out of that creeping self-despair which comes in the train of petty\r\n",
      "anxieties. He felt again some of the old delightful absorption in a\r\n",
      "far-reaching inquiry, while Rosamond played the quiet music which was\r\n",
      "as helpful to his meditation as the plash of an oar on the evening\r\n",
      "lake. It was rather late; he had pushed away all the books, and was\r\n",
      "looking at the fire with his hands clasped behind his head in\r\n",
      "forgetfulness of everything except the construction of a new\r\n",
      "controlling experiment, when Rosamond, who had left the piano and was\r\n",
      "leaning back in her chair watching him, said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house already.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate, startled and jarred, looked up in silence for a moment, like a\r\n",
      "man who has been disturbed in his sleep. Then flushing with an\r\n",
      "unpleasant consciousness, he asked—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How do you know?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I called at Mrs. Plymdale’s this morning, and she told me that he had\r\n",
      "taken the house in St. Peter’s Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate was silent. He drew his hands from behind his head and pressed\r\n",
      "them against the hair which was hanging, as it was apt to do, in a mass\r\n",
      "on his forehead, while he rested his elbows on his knees. He was\r\n",
      "feeling bitter disappointment, as if he had opened a door out of a\r\n",
      "suffocating place and had found it walled up; but he also felt sure\r\n",
      "that Rosamond was pleased with the cause of his disappointment. He\r\n",
      "preferred not looking at her and not speaking, until he had got over\r\n",
      "the first spasm of vexation. After all, he said in his bitterness, what\r\n",
      "can a woman care about so much as house and furniture? a husband\r\n",
      "without them is an absurdity. When he looked up and pushed his hair\r\n",
      "aside, his dark eyes had a miserable blank non-expectance of sympathy\r\n",
      "in them, but he only said, coolly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps some one else may turn up. I told Trumbull to be on the\r\n",
      "look-out if he failed with Plymdale.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond made no remark. She trusted to the chance that nothing more\r\n",
      "would pass between her husband and the auctioneer until some issue\r\n",
      "should have justified her interference; at any rate, she had hindered\r\n",
      "the event which she immediately dreaded. After a pause, she said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How much money is it that those disagreeable people want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What disagreeable people?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Those who took the list—and the others. I mean, how much money would\r\n",
      "satisfy them so that you need not be troubled any more?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate surveyed her for a moment, as if he were looking for symptoms,\r\n",
      "and then said, “Oh, if I could have got six hundred from Plymdale for\r\n",
      "furniture and as premium, I might have managed. I could have paid off\r\n",
      "Dover, and given enough on account to the others to make them wait\r\n",
      "patiently, if we contracted our expenses.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I mean how much should you want if we stayed in this house?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“More than I am likely to get anywhere,” said Lydgate, with rather a\r\n",
      "grating sarcasm in his tone. It angered him to perceive that Rosamond’s\r\n",
      "mind was wandering over impracticable wishes instead of facing possible\r\n",
      "efforts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should you not mention the sum?” said Rosamond, with a mild\r\n",
      "indication that she did not like his manners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” said Lydgate in a guessing tone, “it would take at least a\r\n",
      "thousand to set me at ease. But,” he added, incisively, “I have to\r\n",
      "consider what I shall do without it, not with it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond said no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the next day she carried out her plan of writing to Sir Godwin\r\n",
      "Lydgate. Since the Captain’s visit, she had received a letter from him,\r\n",
      "and also one from Mrs. Mengan, his married sister, condoling with her\r\n",
      "on the loss of her baby, and expressing vaguely the hope that they\r\n",
      "should see her again at Quallingham. Lydgate had told her that this\r\n",
      "politeness meant nothing; but she was secretly convinced that any\r\n",
      "backwardness in Lydgate’s family towards him was due to his cold and\r\n",
      "contemptuous behavior, and she had answered the letters in her most\r\n",
      "charming manner, feeling some confidence that a specific invitation\r\n",
      "would follow. But there had been total silence. The Captain evidently\r\n",
      "was not a great penman, and Rosamond reflected that the sisters might\r\n",
      "have been abroad. However, the season was come for thinking of friends\r\n",
      "at home, and at any rate Sir Godwin, who had chucked her under the\r\n",
      "chin, and pronounced her to be like the celebrated beauty, Mrs. Croly,\r\n",
      "who had made a conquest of him in 1790, would be touched by any appeal\r\n",
      "from her, and would find it pleasant for her sake to behave as he ought\r\n",
      "to do towards his nephew. Rosamond was naively convinced of what an old\r\n",
      "gentleman ought to do to prevent her from suffering annoyance. And she\r\n",
      "wrote what she considered the most judicious letter possible—one which\r\n",
      "would strike Sir Godwin as a proof of her excellent sense—pointing out\r\n",
      "how desirable it was that Tertius should quit such a place as\r\n",
      "Middlemarch for one more fitted to his talents, how the unpleasant\r\n",
      "character of the inhabitants had hindered his professional success, and\r\n",
      "how in consequence he was in money difficulties, from which it would\r\n",
      "require a thousand pounds thoroughly to extricate him. She did not say\r\n",
      "that Tertius was unaware of her intention to write; for she had the\r\n",
      "idea that his supposed sanction of her letter would be in accordance\r\n",
      "with what she did say of his great regard for his uncle Godwin as the\r\n",
      "relative who had always been his best friend. Such was the force of\r\n",
      "Poor Rosamond’s tactics now she applied them to affairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This had happened before the party on New Year’s Day, and no answer had\r\n",
      "yet come from Sir Godwin. But on the morning of that day Lydgate had to\r\n",
      "learn that Rosamond had revoked his order to Borthrop Trumbull. Feeling\r\n",
      "it necessary that she should be gradually accustomed to the idea of\r\n",
      "their quitting the house in Lowick Gate, he overcame his reluctance to\r\n",
      "speak to her again on the subject, and when they were breakfasting\r\n",
      "said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall try to see Trumbull this morning, and tell him to advertise\r\n",
      "the house in the ‘Pioneer’ and the ‘Trumpet.’ If the thing were\r\n",
      "advertised, some one might be inclined to take it who would not\r\n",
      "otherwise have thought of a change. In these country places many people\r\n",
      "go on in their old houses when their families are too large for them,\r\n",
      "for want of knowing where they can find another. And Trumbull seems to\r\n",
      "have got no bite at all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond knew that the inevitable moment was come. “I ordered Trumbull\r\n",
      "not to inquire further,” she said, with a careful calmness which was\r\n",
      "evidently defensive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate stared at her in mute amazement. Only half an hour before he\r\n",
      "had been fastening up her plaits for her, and talking the “little\r\n",
      "language” of affection, which Rosamond, though not returning it,\r\n",
      "accepted as if she had been a serene and lovely image, now and then\r\n",
      "miraculously dimpling towards her votary. With such fibres still astir\r\n",
      "in him, the shock he received could not at once be distinctly anger; it\r\n",
      "was confused pain. He laid down the knife and fork with which he was\r\n",
      "carving, and throwing himself back in his chair, said at last, with a\r\n",
      "cool irony in his tone—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I ask when and why you did so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When I knew that the Plymdales had taken a house, I called to tell him\r\n",
      "not to mention ours to them; and at the same time I told him not to let\r\n",
      "the affair go on any further. I knew that it would be very injurious to\r\n",
      "you if it were known that you wished to part with your house and\r\n",
      "furniture, and I had a very strong objection to it. I think that was\r\n",
      "reason enough.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was of no consequence then that I had told you imperative reasons\r\n",
      "of another kind; of no consequence that I had come to a different\r\n",
      "conclusion, and given an order accordingly?” said Lydgate, bitingly,\r\n",
      "the thunder and lightning gathering about his brow and eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect of any one’s anger on Rosamond had always been to make her\r\n",
      "shrink in cold dislike, and to become all the more calmly correct, in\r\n",
      "the conviction that she was not the person to misbehave whatever others\r\n",
      "might do. She replied—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think I had a perfect right to speak on a subject which concerns me\r\n",
      "at least as much as you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Clearly—you had a right to speak, but only to me. You had no right to\r\n",
      "contradict my orders secretly, and treat me as if I were a fool,” said\r\n",
      "Lydgate, in the same tone as before. Then with some added scorn, “Is it\r\n",
      "possible to make you understand what the consequences will be? Is it of\r\n",
      "any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the\r\n",
      "house?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is not necessary for you to tell me again,” said Rosamond, in a\r\n",
      "voice that fell and trickled like cold water-drops. “I remembered what\r\n",
      "you said. You spoke just as violently as you do now. But that does not\r\n",
      "alter my opinion that you ought to try every other means rather than\r\n",
      "take a step which is so painful to me. And as to advertising the house,\r\n",
      "I think it would be perfectly degrading to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And suppose I disregard your opinion as you disregard mine?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can do so, of course. But I think you ought to have told me before\r\n",
      "we were married that you would place me in the worst position, rather\r\n",
      "than give up your own will.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate did not speak, but tossed his head on one side, and twitched\r\n",
      "the corners of his mouth in despair. Rosamond, seeing that he was not\r\n",
      "looking at her, rose and set his cup of coffee before him; but he took\r\n",
      "no notice of it, and went on with an inward drama and argument,\r\n",
      "occasionally moving in his seat, resting one arm on the table, and\r\n",
      "rubbing his hand against his hair. There was a conflux of emotions and\r\n",
      "thoughts in him that would not let him either give thorough way to his\r\n",
      "anger or persevere with simple rigidity of resolve. Rosamond took\r\n",
      "advantage of his silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When we were married everyone felt that your position was very high. I\r\n",
      "could not have imagined then that you would want to sell our furniture,\r\n",
      "and take a house in Bride Street, where the rooms are like cages. If we\r\n",
      "are to live in that way let us at least leave Middlemarch.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“These would be very strong considerations,” said Lydgate, half\r\n",
      "ironically—still there was a withered paleness about his lips as he\r\n",
      "looked at his coffee, and did not drink—“these would be very strong\r\n",
      "considerations if I did not happen to be in debt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Many persons must have been in debt in the same way, but if they are\r\n",
      "respectable, people trust them. I am sure I have heard papa say that\r\n",
      "the Torbits were in debt, and they went on very well. It cannot be good\r\n",
      "to act rashly,” said Rosamond, with serene wisdom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate sat paralyzed by opposing impulses: since no reasoning he could\r\n",
      "apply to Rosamond seemed likely to conquer her assent, he wanted to\r\n",
      "smash and grind some object on which he could at least produce an\r\n",
      "impression, or else to tell her brutally that he was master, and she\r\n",
      "must obey. But he not only dreaded the effect of such extremities on\r\n",
      "their mutual life—he had a growing dread of Rosamond’s quiet elusive\r\n",
      "obstinacy, which would not allow any assertion of power to be final;\r\n",
      "and again, she had touched him in a spot of keenest feeling by implying\r\n",
      "that she had been deluded with a false vision of happiness in marrying\r\n",
      "him. As to saying that he was master, it was not the fact. The very\r\n",
      "resolution to which he had wrought himself by dint of logic and\r\n",
      "honorable pride was beginning to relax under her torpedo contact. He\r\n",
      "swallowed half his cup of coffee, and then rose to go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I may at least request that you will not go to Trumbull at\r\n",
      "present—until it has been seen that there are no other means,” said\r\n",
      "Rosamond. Although she was not subject to much fear, she felt it safer\r\n",
      "not to betray that she had written to Sir Godwin. “Promise me that you\r\n",
      "will not go to him for a few weeks, or without telling me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate gave a short laugh. “I think it is I who should exact a promise\r\n",
      "that you will do nothing without telling me,” he said, turning his eyes\r\n",
      "sharply upon her, and then moving to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You remember that we are going to dine at papa’s,” said Rosamond,\r\n",
      "wishing that he should turn and make a more thorough concession to her.\r\n",
      "But he only said “Oh yes,” impatiently, and went away. She held it to\r\n",
      "be very odious in him that he did not think the painful propositions he\r\n",
      "had had to make to her were enough, without showing so unpleasant a\r\n",
      "temper. And when she put the moderate request that he would defer going\r\n",
      "to Trumbull again, it was cruel in him not to assure her of what he\r\n",
      "meant to do. She was convinced of her having acted in every way for the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "on your not acting secretly in future?” said Lydgate, urgently, but\r\n",
      "with something of request in his tone which Rosamond was quick to\r\n",
      "perceive. She spoke with coolness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot possibly make admissions or promises in answer to such words\r\n",
      "as you have used towards me. I have not been accustomed to language of\r\n",
      "that kind. You have spoken of my ‘secret meddling,’ and my ‘interfering\r\n",
      "ignorance,’ and my ‘false assent.’ I have never expressed myself in\r\n",
      "that way to you, and I think that you ought to apologize. You spoke of\r\n",

      "life pleasant to me of late. I think it was to be expected that I\r\n",

      "flung an arm over the back of his chair, and looked down for some\r\n",
      "moments without speaking. Rosamond had the double purchase over him of\r\n",
      "insensibility to the point of justice in his reproach, and of\r\n",
      "sensibility to the undeniable hardships now present in her married\r\n",
      "life. Although her duplicity in the affair of the house had exceeded\r\n",
      "what he knew, and had really hindered the Plymdales from knowing of it,\r\n",
      "she had no consciousness that her action could rightly be called false.\r\n",
      "We are not obliged to identify our own acts according to a strict\r\n",
      "classification, any more than the materials of our grocery and clothes.\r\n",
      "Rosamond felt that she was aggrieved, and that this was what Lydgate\r\n",
      "had to recognize.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for him, the need of accommodating himself to her nature, which was\r\n",
      "inflexible in proportion to its negations, held him as with pincers. He\r\n",
      "had begun to have an alarmed foresight of her irrevocable loss of love\r\n",
      "for him, and the consequent dreariness of their life. The ready fulness\r\n",
      "of his emotions made this dread alternate quickly with the first\r\n",
      "violent movements of his anger. It would assuredly have been a vain\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You have not made my life pleasant to me of late”—“the hardships which\r\n",

      "fettering of domestic hate?\r\n",

      "softened feeling now that her husband had softened. “It is so very hard\r\n",
      "to be disgraced here among all the people we know, and to live in such\r\n",
      "a miserable way. I wish I had died with the baby.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She spoke and wept with that gentleness which makes such words and\r\n",
      "tears omnipotent over a loving-hearted man. Lydgate drew his chair near\r\n",
      "to hers and pressed her delicate head against his cheek with his\r\n",
      "powerful tender hand. He only caressed her; he did not say anything;\r\n",
      "for what was there to say? He could not promise to shield her from the\r\n",
      "dreaded wretchedness, for he could see no sure means of doing so. When\r\n",
      "he left her to go out again, he told himself that it was ten times\r\n",
      "harder for her than for him: he had a life away from home, and constant\r\n",
      "appeals to his activity on behalf of others. He wished to excuse\r\n",
      "everything in her if he could—but it was inevitable that in that\r\n",
      "excusing mood he should think of her as if she were an animal of\r\n",

      "the earliest stages of excitement from drink. It was the same with\r\n",
      "gambling. He had looked on at a great deal of gambling in Paris,\r\n",

      "regarded as men of pleasure. It was here that poor Fred Vincy had made\r\n",
      "part of his memorable debt, having lost money in betting, and been\r\n",
      "obliged to borrow of that gay companion. It was generally known in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch that a good deal of money was lost and won in this way; and\r\n",
      "the consequent repute of the Green Dragon as a place of dissipation\r\n",
      "naturally heightened in some quarters the temptation to go there.\r\n",
      "Probably its regular visitants, like the initiates of freemasonry,\r\n",
      "wished that there were something a little more tremendous to keep to\r\n",
      "themselves concerning it; but they were not a closed community, and\r\n",
      "many decent seniors as well as juniors occasionally turned into the\r\n",
      "billiard-room to see what was going on. Lydgate, who had the muscular\r\n",
      "aptitude for billiards, and was fond of the game, had once or twice in\r\n",
      "the early days after his arrival in Middlemarch taken his turn with the\r\n",
      "cue at the Green Dragon; but afterwards he had no leisure for the game,\r\n",
      "and no inclination for the socialities there. One evening, however, he\r\n",
      "had occasion to seek Mr. Bambridge at that resort. The horsedealer had\r\n",
      "engaged to get him a customer for his remaining good horse, for which\r\n",
      "Lydgate had determined to substitute a cheap hack, hoping by this\r\n",
      "reduction of style to get perhaps twenty pounds; and he cared now for\r\n",
      "every small sum, as a help towards feeding the patience of his\r\n",
      "tradesmen. To run up to the billiard-room, as he was passing, would\r\n",
      "save time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bambridge was not yet come, but would be sure to arrive by-and-by,\r\n",
      "said his friend Mr. Horrock; and Lydgate stayed, playing a game for the\r\n",
      "sake of passing the time. That evening he had the peculiar light in the\r\n",
      "eyes and the unusual vivacity which had been once noticed in him by Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother. The exceptional fact of his presence was much noticed in\r\n",
      "the room, where there was a good deal of Middlemarch company; and\r\n",
      "several lookers-on, as well as some of the players, were betting with\r\n",
      "animation. Lydgate was playing well, and felt confident; the bets were\r\n",
      "dropping round him, and with a swift glancing thought of the probable\r\n",
      "gain which might double the sum he was saving from his horse, he began\r\n",
      "to bet on his own play, and won again and again. Mr. Bambridge had come\r\n",
      "in, but Lydgate did not notice him. He was not only excited with his\r\n",
      "play, but visions were gleaming on him of going the next day to\r\n",
      "Brassing, where there was gambling on a grander scale to be had, and\r\n",
      "where, by one powerful snatch at the devil’s bait, he might carry it\r\n",
      "off without the hook, and buy his rescue from his daily solicitings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was still winning when two new visitors entered. One of them was a\r\n",
      "young Hawley, just come from his law studies in town, and the other was\r\n",
      "Fred Vincy, who had spent several evenings of late at this old haunt of\r\n",
      "his. Young Hawley, an accomplished billiard-player, brought a cool\r\n",
      "fresh hand to the cue. But Fred Vincy, startled at seeing Lydgate, and\r\n",
      "astonished to see him betting with an excited air, stood aside, and\r\n",
      "kept out of the circle round the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred had been rewarding resolution by a little laxity of late. He had\r\n",
      "been working heartily for six months at all outdoor occupations under\r\n",
      "Mr. Garth, and by dint of severe practice had nearly mastered the\r\n",
      "defects of his handwriting, this practice being, perhaps, a little the\r\n",
      "less severe that it was often carried on in the evening at Mr. Garth’s\r\n",
      "under the eyes of Mary. But the last fortnight Mary had been staying at\r\n",
      "Lowick Parsonage with the ladies there, during Mr. Farebrother’s\r\n",
      "residence in Middlemarch, where he was carrying out some parochial\r\n",
      "plans; and Fred, not seeing anything more agreeable to do, had turned\r\n",
      "into the Green Dragon, partly to play at billiards, partly to taste the\r\n",
      "old flavor of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general,\r\n",
      "considered from a point of view which was not strenuously correct. He\r\n",
      "had not been out hunting once this season, had had no horse of his own\r\n",
      "to ride, and had gone from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in his\r\n",
      "gig, or on the sober cob which Mr. Garth could lend him. It was a\r\n",
      "little too bad, Fred began to think, that he should be kept in the\r\n",
      "traces with more severity than if he had been a clergyman. “I will tell\r\n",
      "you what, Mistress Mary—it will be rather harder work to learn\r\n",
      "surveying and drawing plans than it would have been to write sermons,”\r\n",
      "he had said, wishing her to appreciate what he went through for her\r\n",
      "sake; “and as to Hercules and Theseus, they were nothing to me. They\r\n",
      "had sport, and never learned to write a bookkeeping hand.” And now,\r\n",
      "Mary being out of the way for a little while, Fred, like any other\r\n",
      "strong dog who cannot slip his collar, had pulled up the staple of his\r\n",
      "chain and made a small escape, not of course meaning to go fast or far.\r\n",
      "There could be no reason why he should not play at billiards, but he\r\n",
      "was determined not to bet. As to money just now, Fred had in his mind\r\n",
      "the heroic project of saving almost all of the eighty pounds that Mr.\r\n",
      "Garth offered him, and returning it, which he could easily do by giving\r\n",
      "up all futile money-spending, since he had a superfluous stock of\r\n",
      "clothes, and no expense in his board. In that way he could, in one\r\n",
      "year, go a good way towards repaying the ninety pounds of which he had\r\n",
      "deprived Mrs. Garth, unhappily at a time when she needed that sum more\r\n",
      "than she did now. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that on this\r\n",
      "evening, which was the fifth of his recent visits to the billiard-room,\r\n",
      "Fred had, not in his pocket, but in his mind, the ten pounds which he\r\n",
      "meant to reserve for himself from his half-year’s salary (having before\r\n",
      "him the pleasure of carrying thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely\r\n",
      "to be come home again)—he had those ten pounds in his mind as a fund\r\n",
      "from which he might risk something, if there were a chance of a good\r\n",
      "bet. Why? Well, when sovereigns were flying about, why shouldn’t he\r\n",
      "catch a few? He would never go far along that road again; but a man\r\n",
      "likes to assure himself, and men of pleasure generally, what he could\r\n",
      "do in the way of mischief if he chose, and that if he abstains from\r\n",
      "making himself ill, or beggaring himself, or talking with the utmost\r\n",
      "looseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow, it is\r\n",
      "not because he is a spooney. Fred did not enter into formal reasons,\r\n",
      "which are a very artificial, inexact way of representing the tingling\r\n",
      "returns of old habit, and the caprices of young blood: but there was\r\n",
      "lurking in him a prophetic sense that evening, that when he began to\r\n",
      "play he should also begin to bet—that he should enjoy some\r\n",
      "punch-drinking, and in general prepare himself for feeling “rather\r\n",
      "seedy” in the morning. It is in such indefinable movements that action\r\n",
      "often begins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the last thing likely to have entered Fred’s expectation was that\r\n",
      "he should see his brother-in-law Lydgate—of whom he had never quite\r\n",
      "dropped the old opinion that he was a prig, and tremendously conscious\r\n",
      "of his superiority—looking excited and betting, just as he himself\r\n",
      "might have done. Fred felt a shock greater than he could quite account\r\n",
      "for by the vague knowledge that Lydgate was in debt, and that his\r\n",
      "father had refused to help him; and his own inclination to enter into\r\n",
      "the play was suddenly checked. It was a strange reversal of attitudes:\r\n",
      "Fred’s blond face and blue eyes, usually bright and careless, ready to\r\n",
      "give attention to anything that held out a promise of amusement,\r\n",
      "looking involuntarily grave and almost embarrassed as if by the sight\r\n",
      "of something unfitting; while Lydgate, who had habitually an air of\r\n",
      "self-possessed strength, and a certain meditativeness that seemed to\r\n",
      "lie behind his most observant attention, was acting, watching, speaking\r\n",
      "with that excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal\r\n",
      "with fierce eyes and retractile claws.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate, by betting on his own strokes, had won sixteen pounds; but\r\n",
      "young Hawley’s arrival had changed the poise of things. He made\r\n",
      "first-rate strokes himself, and began to bet against Lydgate’s strokes,\r\n",
      "the strain of whose nerves was thus changed from simple confidence in\r\n",
      "his own movements to defying another person’s doubt in them. The\r\n",
      "defiance was more exciting than the confidence, but it was less sure.\r\n",
      "He continued to bet on his own play, but began often to fail. Still he\r\n",
      "went on, for his mind was as utterly narrowed into that precipitous\r\n",
      "crevice of play as if he had been the most ignorant lounger there. Fred\r\n",
      "observed that Lydgate was losing fast, and found himself in the new\r\n",
      "situation of puzzling his brains to think of some device by which,\r\n",
      "without being offensive, he could withdraw Lydgate’s attention, and\r\n",
      "perhaps suggest to him a reason for quitting the room. He saw that\r\n",
      "others were observing Lydgate’s strange unlikeness to himself, and it\r\n",
      "occurred to him that merely to touch his elbow and call him aside for a\r\n",
      "moment might rouse him from his absorption. He could think of nothing\r\n",
      "cleverer than the daring improbability of saying that he wanted to see\r\n",
      "Rosy, and wished to know if she were at home this evening; and he was\r\n",
      "going desperately to carry out this weak device, when a waiter came up\r\n",
      "to him with a message, saying that Mr. Farebrother was below, and\r\n",
      "begged to speak with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred was surprised, not quite comfortably, but sending word that he\r\n",
      "would be down immediately, he went with a new impulse up to Lydgate,\r\n",
      "said, “Can I speak to you a moment?” and drew him aside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Farebrother has just sent up a message to say that he wants to speak\r\n",
      "to me. He is below. I thought you might like to know he was there, if\r\n",
      "you had anything to say to him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred had simply snatched up this pretext for speaking, because he could\r\n",
      "not say, “You are losing confoundedly, and are making everybody stare\r\n",
      "at you; you had better come away.” But inspiration could hardly have\r\n",
      "served him better. Lydgate had not before seen that Fred was present,\r\n",
      "and his sudden appearance with an announcement of Mr. Farebrother had\r\n",
      "the effect of a sharp concussion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no,” said Lydgate; “I have nothing particular to say to him.\r\n",
      "But—the game is up—I must be going—I came in just to see Bambridge.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bambridge is over there, but he is making a row—I don’t think he’s\r\n",
      "ready for business. Come down with me to Farebrother. I expect he is\r\n",
      "going to blow me up, and you will shield me,” said Fred, with some\r\n",
      "adroitness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate felt shame, but could not bear to act as if he felt it, by\r\n",
      "refusing to see Mr. Farebrother; and he went down. They merely shook\r\n",
      "hands, however, and spoke of the frost; and when all three had turned\r\n",
      "into the street, the Vicar seemed quite willing to say good-by to\r\n",
      "Lydgate. His present purpose was clearly to talk with Fred alone, and\r\n",
      "he said, kindly, “I disturbed you, young gentleman, because I have some\r\n",
      "pressing business with you. Walk with me to St. Botolph’s, will you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a fine night, the sky thick with stars, and Mr. Farebrother\r\n",
      "proposed that they should make a circuit to the old church by the\r\n",
      "London road. The next thing he said was—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought Lydgate never went to the Green Dragon?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So did I,” said Fred. “But he said that he went to see Bambridge.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He was not playing, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred had not meant to tell this, but he was obliged now to say, “Yes,\r\n",
      "he was. But I suppose it was an accidental thing. I have never seen him\r\n",
      "there before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have been going often yourself, then, lately?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, about five or six times.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going\r\n",
      "there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes. You know all about it,” said Fred, not liking to be catechised in\r\n",
      "this way. “I made a clean breast to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose that gives me a warrant to speak about the matter now. It is\r\n",
      "understood between us, is it not?—that we are on a footing of open\r\n",
      "friendship: I have listened to you, and you will be willing to listen\r\n",
      "to me. I may take my turn in talking a little about myself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am under the deepest obligation to you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred,\r\n",
      "in a state of uncomfortable surmise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will not affect to deny that you are under some obligation to me.\r\n",
      "But I am going to confess to you, Fred, that I have been tempted to\r\n",
      "reverse all that by keeping silence with you just now. When somebody\r\n",
      "said to me, ‘Young Vincy has taken to being at the billiard-table every\r\n",
      "night again—he won’t bear the curb long;’ I was tempted to do the\r\n",
      "opposite of what I am doing—to hold my tongue and wait while you went\r\n",
      "down the ladder again, betting first and then—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have not made any bets,” said Fred, hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Glad to hear it. But I say, my prompting was to look on and see you\r\n",
      "take the wrong turning, wear out Garth’s patience, and lose the best\r\n",
      "opportunity of your life—the opportunity which you made some rather\r\n",
      "difficult effort to secure. You can guess the feeling which raised that\r\n",
      "temptation in me—I am sure you know it. I am sure you know that the\r\n",
      "satisfaction of your affections stands in the way of mine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a pause. Mr. Farebrother seemed to wait for a recognition of\r\n",
      "the fact; and the emotion perceptible in the tones of his fine voice\r\n",
      "gave solemnity to his words. But no feeling could quell Fred’s alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I could not be expected to give her up,” he said, after a moment’s\r\n",
      "hesitation: it was not a case for any pretence of generosity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Clearly not, when her affection met yours. But relations of this sort,\r\n",
      "even when they are of long standing, are always liable to change. I can\r\n",
      "easily conceive that you might act in a way to loosen the tie she feels\r\n",
      "towards you—it must be remembered that she is only conditionally bound\r\n",
      "to you—and that in that case, another man, who may flatter himself that\r\n",
      "he has a hold on her regard, might succeed in winning that firm place\r\n",
      "in her love as well as respect which you had let slip. I can easily\r\n",
      "conceive such a result,” repeated Mr. Farebrother, emphatically. “There\r\n",
      "is a companionship of ready sympathy, which might get the advantage\r\n",
      "even over the longest associations.” It seemed to Fred that if Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother had had a beak and talons instead of his very capable\r\n",
      "tongue, his mode of attack could hardly be more cruel. He had a\r\n",
      "horrible conviction that behind all this hypothetic statement there was\r\n",
      "a knowledge of some actual change in Mary’s feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course I know it might easily be all up with me,” he said, in a\r\n",
      "troubled voice. “If she is beginning to compare—” He broke off, not\r\n",
      "liking to betray all he felt, and then said, by the help of a little\r\n",
      "bitterness, “But I thought you were friendly to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So I am; that is why we are here. But I have had a strong disposition\r\n",
      "to be otherwise. I have said to myself, ‘If there is a likelihood of\r\n",
      "that youngster doing himself harm, why should you interfere? Aren’t you\r\n",
      "worth as much as he is, and don’t your sixteen years over and above\r\n",
      "his, in which you have gone rather hungry, give you more right to\r\n",
      "satisfaction than he has? If there’s a chance of his going to the dogs,\r\n",
      "let him—perhaps you could nohow hinder it—and do you take the\r\n",
      "benefit.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a pause, in which Fred was seized by a most uncomfortable\r\n",
      "chill. What was coming next? He dreaded to hear that something had been\r\n",
      "said to Mary—he felt as if he were listening to a threat rather than a\r\n",
      "warning. When the Vicar began again there was a change in his tone like\r\n",
      "the encouraging transition to a major key.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I had once meant better than that, and I am come back to my old\r\n",
      "intention. I thought that I could hardly _secure myself_ in it better,\r\n",
      "Fred, than by telling you just what had gone on in me. And now, do you\r\n",
      "understand me? I want you to make the happiness of her life and your\r\n",
      "own, and if there is any chance that a word of warning from me may turn\r\n",
      "aside any risk to the contrary—well, I have uttered it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a drop in the Vicar’s voice when he spoke the last words. He\r\n",
      "paused—they were standing on a patch of green where the road diverged\r\n",
      "towards St. Botolph’s, and he put out his hand, as if to imply that the\r\n",
      "conversation was closed. Fred was moved quite newly. Some one highly\r\n",
      "susceptible to the contemplation of a fine act has said, that it\r\n",
      "produces a sort of regenerating shudder through the frame, and makes\r\n",
      "one feel ready to begin a new life. A good degree of that effect was\r\n",
      "just then present in Fred Vincy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will try to be worthy,” he said, breaking off before he could say\r\n",
      "“of you as well as of her.” And meanwhile Mr. Farebrother had gathered\r\n",
      "the impulse to say something more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must not imagine that I believe there is at present any decline in\r\n",
      "her preference of you, Fred. Set your heart at rest, that if you keep\r\n",
      "right, other things will keep right.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall never forget what you have done,” Fred answered. “I can’t say\r\n",
      "anything that seems worth saying—only I will try that your goodness\r\n",
      "shall not be thrown away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s enough. Good-by, and God bless you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In that way they parted. But both of them walked about a long while\r\n",
      "before they went out of the starlight. Much of Fred’s rumination might\r\n",
      "be summed up in the words, “It certainly would have been a fine thing\r\n",
      "for her to marry Farebrother—but if she loves me best and I am a good\r\n",
      "husband?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps Mr. Farebrother’s might be concentrated into a single shrug and\r\n",
      "one little speech. “To think of the part one little woman can play in\r\n",
      "the life of a man, so that to renounce her may be a very good imitation\r\n",

      "most unpleasant vision of the figure he had made, not only rubbing\r\n",
      "elbows with the men at the Green Dragon but behaving just as they did.\r\n",
      "A philosopher fallen to betting is hardly distinguishable from a\r\n",
      "Philistine under the same circumstances: the difference will chiefly be\r\n",
      "found in his subsequent reflections, and Lydgate chewed a very\r\n",
      "disagreeable cud in that way. His reason told him how the affair might\r\n",
      "have been magnified into ruin by a slight change of scenery—if it had\r\n",
      "been a gambling-house that he had turned into, where chance could be\r\n",
      "clutched with both hands instead of being picked up with thumb and\r\n",
      "fore-finger. Nevertheless, though reason strangled the desire to\r\n",
      "gamble, there remained the feeling that, with an assurance of luck to\r\n",
      "the needful amount, he would have liked to gamble, rather than take the\r\n",
      "alternative which was beginning to urge itself as inevitable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That alternative was to apply to Mr. Bulstrode. Lydgate had so many\r\n",
      "times boasted both to himself and others that he was totally\r\n",
      "independent of Bulstrode, to whose plans he had lent himself solely\r\n",
      "because they enabled him to carry out his own ideas of professional\r\n",
      "work and public benefit—he had so constantly in their personal\r\n",
      "intercourse had his pride sustained by the sense that he was making a\r\n",
      "good social use of this predominating banker, whose opinions he thought\r\n",
      "contemptible and whose motives often seemed to him an absurd mixture of\r\n",
      "contradictory impressions—that he had been creating for himself strong\r\n",
      "ideal obstacles to the proffering of any considerable request to him on\r\n",
      "his own account.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, early in March his affairs were at that pass in which men begin\r\n",
      "to say that their oaths were delivered in ignorance, and to perceive\r\n",
      "that the act which they had called impossible to them is becoming\r\n",
      "manifestly possible. With Dover’s ugly security soon to be put in\r\n",
      "force, with the proceeds of his practice immediately absorbed in paying\r\n",
      "back debts, and with the chance, if the worst were known, of daily\r\n",
      "supplies being refused on credit, above all with the vision of\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s hopeless discontent continually haunting him, Lydgate had\r\n",
      "begun to see that he should inevitably bend himself to ask help from\r\n",
      "somebody or other. At first he had considered whether he should write\r\n",
      "to Mr. Vincy; but on questioning Rosamond he found that, as he had\r\n",
      "suspected, she had already applied twice to her father, the last time\r\n",
      "being since the disappointment from Sir Godwin; and papa had said that\r\n",
      "Lydgate must look out for himself. “Papa said he had come, with one bad\r\n",
      "year after another, to trade more and more on borrowed capital, and had\r\n",
      "had to give up many indulgences; he could not spare a single hundred\r\n",
      "from the charges of his family. He said, let Lydgate ask Bulstrode:\r\n",
      "they have always been hand and glove.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Indeed, Lydgate himself had come to the conclusion that if he must end\r\n",
      "by asking for a free loan, his relations with Bulstrode, more at least\r\n",
      "than with any other man, might take the shape of a claim which was not\r\n",
      "purely personal. Bulstrode had indirectly helped to cause the failure\r\n",
      "of his practice, and had also been highly gratified by getting a\r\n",
      "medical partner in his plans:—but who among us ever reduced himself to\r\n",
      "the sort of dependence in which Lydgate now stood, without trying to\r\n",
      "believe that he had claims which diminished the humiliation of asking?\r\n",
      "It was true that of late there had seemed to be a new languor of\r\n",
      "interest in Bulstrode about the Hospital; but his health had got worse,\r\n",
      "and showed signs of a deep-seated nervous affection. In other respects\r\n",
      "he did not appear to be changed: he had always been highly polite, but\r\n",
      "Lydgate had observed in him from the first a marked coldness about his\r\n",
      "marriage and other private circumstances, a coldness which he had\r\n",
      "hitherto preferred to any warmth of familiarity between them. He\r\n",
      "deferred the intention from day to day, his habit of acting on his\r\n",
      "conclusions being made infirm by his repugnance to every possible\r\n",
      "conclusion and its consequent act. He saw Mr. Bulstrode often, but he\r\n",
      "did not try to use any occasion for his private purpose. At one moment\r\n",
      "he thought, “I will write a letter: I prefer that to any circuitous\r\n",
      "talk;” at another he thought, “No; if I were talking to him, I could\r\n",
      "make a retreat before any signs of disinclination.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still the days passed and no letter was written, no special interview\r\n",
      "sought. In his shrinking from the humiliation of a dependent attitude\r\n",
      "towards Bulstrode, he began to familiarize his imagination with another\r\n",
      "step even more unlike his remembered self. He began spontaneously to\r\n",
      "consider whether it would be possible to carry out that puerile notion\r\n",
      "of Rosamond’s which had often made him angry, namely, that they should\r\n",
      "quit Middlemarch without seeing anything beyond that preface. The\r\n",
      "question came—“Would any man buy the practice of me even now, for as\r\n",
      "little as it is worth? Then the sale might happen as a necessary\r\n",
      "preparation for going away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But against his taking this step, which he still felt to be a\r\n",
      "contemptible relinquishment of present work, a guilty turning aside\r\n",
      "from what was a real and might be a widening channel for worthy\r\n",
      "activity, to start again without any justified destination, there was\r\n",
      "this obstacle, that the purchaser, if procurable at all, might not be\r\n",
      "quickly forthcoming. And afterwards? Rosamond in a poor lodging, though\r\n",
      "in the largest city or most distant town, would not find the life that\r\n",
      "could save her from gloom, and save him from the reproach of having\r\n",
      "plunged her into it. For when a man is at the foot of the hill in his\r\n",
      "fortunes, he may stay a long while there in spite of professional\r\n",
      "accomplishment. In the British climate there is no incompatibility\r\n",
      "between scientific insight and furnished lodgings: the incompatibility\r\n",
      "is chiefly between scientific ambition and a wife who objects to that\r\n",
      "kind of residence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in the midst of his hesitation, opportunity came to decide him. A\r\n",
      "note from Mr. Bulstrode requested Lydgate to call on him at the Bank. A\r\n",
      "hypochondriacal tendency had shown itself in the banker’s constitution\r\n",
      "of late; and a lack of sleep, which was really only a slight\r\n",
      "exaggeration of an habitual dyspeptic symptom, had been dwelt on by him\r\n",
      "as a sign of threatening insanity. He wanted to consult Lydgate without\r\n",
      "delay on that particular morning, although he had nothing to tell\r\n",
      "beyond what he had told before. He listened eagerly to what Lydgate had\r\n",
      "to say in dissipation of his fears, though this too was only\r\n",
      "repetition; and this moment in which Bulstrode was receiving a medical\r\n",
      "opinion with a sense of comfort, seemed to make the communication of a\r\n",
      "personal need to him easier than it had been in Lydgate’s contemplation\r\n",
      "beforehand. He had been insisting that it would be well for Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode to relax his attention to business.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One sees how any mental strain, however slight, may affect a delicate\r\n",
      "frame,” said Lydgate at that stage of the consultation when the remarks\r\n",
      "tend to pass from the personal to the general, “by the deep stamp which\r\n",
      "anxiety will make for a time even on the young and vigorous. I am\r\n",
      "naturally very strong; yet I have been thoroughly shaken lately by an\r\n",
      "accumulation of trouble.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I presume that a constitution in the susceptible state in which mine\r\n",
      "at present is, would be especially liable to fall a victim to cholera,\r\n",
      "if it visited our district. And since its appearance near London, we\r\n",
      "may well besiege the Mercy-seat for our protection,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, not intending to evade Lydgate’s allusion, but really\r\n",
      "preoccupied with alarms about himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have at all events taken your share in using good practical\r\n",
      "precautions for the town, and that is the best mode of asking for\r\n",
      "protection,” said Lydgate, with a strong distaste for the broken\r\n",
      "metaphor and bad logic of the banker’s religion, somewhat increased by\r\n",
      "the apparent deafness of his sympathy. But his mind had taken up its\r\n",
      "long-prepared movement towards getting help, and was not yet arrested.\r\n",
      "He added, “The town has done well in the way of cleansing, and finding\r\n",
      "appliances; and I think that if the cholera should come, even our\r\n",
      "enemies will admit that the arrangements in the Hospital are a public\r\n",
      "good.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Truly,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with some coldness. “With regard to what\r\n",
      "you say, Mr. Lydgate, about the relaxation of my mental labor, I have\r\n",
      "for some time been entertaining a purpose to that effect—a purpose of a\r\n",
      "very decided character. I contemplate at least a temporary withdrawal\r\n",
      "from the management of much business, whether benevolent or commercial.\r\n",
      "Also I think of changing my residence for a time: probably I shall\r\n",
      "close or let ‘The Shrubs,’ and take some place near the coast—under\r\n",
      "advice of course as to salubrity. That would be a measure which you\r\n",
      "would recommend?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes,” said Lydgate, falling backward in his chair, with\r\n",
      "ill-repressed impatience under the banker’s pale earnest eyes and\r\n",
      "intense preoccupation with himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have for some time felt that I should open this subject with you in\r\n",
      "relation to our Hospital,” continued Bulstrode. “Under the\r\n",
      "circumstances I have indicated, of course I must cease to have any\r\n",
      "personal share in the management, and it is contrary to my views of\r\n",
      "responsibility to continue a large application of means to an\r\n",
      "institution which I cannot watch over and to some extent regulate. I\r\n",
      "shall therefore, in case of my ultimate decision to leave Middlemarch,\r\n",
      "consider that I withdraw other support to the New Hospital than that\r\n",
      "which will subsist in the fact that I chiefly supplied the expenses of\r\n",
      "building it, and have contributed further large sums to its successful\r\n",
      "working.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s thought, when Bulstrode paused according to his wont, was,\r\n",
      "“He has perhaps been losing a good deal of money.” This was the most\r\n",
      "plausible explanation of a speech which had caused rather a startling\r\n",
      "change in his expectations. He said in reply—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The loss to the Hospital can hardly be made up, I fear.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hardly,” returned Bulstrode, in the same deliberate, silvery tone;\r\n",
      "“except by some changes of plan. The only person who may be certainly\r\n",
      "counted on as willing to increase her contributions is Mrs. Casaubon. I\r\n",
      "have had an interview with her on the subject, and I have pointed out\r\n",
      "to her, as I am about to do to you, that it will be desirable to win a\r\n",
      "more general support to the New Hospital by a change of system.”\r\n",
      "Another pause, but Lydgate did not speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The change I mean is an amalgamation with the Infirmary, so that the\r\n",
      "New Hospital shall be regarded as a special addition to the elder\r\n",
      "institution, having the same directing board. It will be necessary,\r\n",
      "also, that the medical management of the two shall be combined. In this\r\n",
      "way any difficulty as to the adequate maintenance of our new\r\n",
      "establishment will be removed; the benevolent interests of the town\r\n",
      "will cease to be divided.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode had lowered his eyes from Lydgate’s face to the buttons\r\n",
      "of his coat as he again paused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No doubt that is a good device as to ways and means,” said Lydgate,\r\n",
      "with an edge of irony in his tone. “But I can’t be expected to rejoice\r\n",
      "in it at once, since one of the first results will be that the other\r\n",
      "medical men will upset or interrupt my methods, if it were only because\r\n",
      "they are mine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I myself, as you know, Mr. Lydgate, highly valued the opportunity of\r\n",
      "new and independent procedure which you have diligently employed: the\r\n",
      "original plan, I confess, was one which I had much at heart, under\r\n",
      "submission to the Divine Will. But since providential indications\r\n",
      "demand a renunciation from me, I renounce.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode showed a rather exasperating ability in this conversation.\r\n",
      "The broken metaphor and bad logic of motive which had stirred his\r\n",
      "hearer’s contempt were quite consistent with a mode of putting the\r\n",
      "facts which made it difficult for Lydgate to vent his own indignation\r\n",
      "and disappointment. After some rapid reflection, he only asked—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did Mrs. Casaubon say?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was the further statement which I wished to make to you,” said\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, who had thoroughly prepared his ministerial explanation.\r\n",
      "“She is, you are aware, a woman of most munificent disposition, and\r\n",
      "happily in possession—not I presume of great wealth, but of funds which\r\n",
      "she can well spare. She has informed me that though she has destined\r\n",
      "the chief part of those funds to another purpose, she is willing to\r\n",
      "consider whether she cannot fully take my place in relation to the\r\n",
      "Hospital. But she wishes for ample time to mature her thoughts on the\r\n",
      "subject, and I have told her that there is no need for haste—that, in\r\n",
      "fact, my own plans are not yet absolute.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate was ready to say, “If Mrs. Casaubon would take your place,\r\n",
      "there would be gain, instead of loss.” But there was still a weight on\r\n",
      "his mind which arrested this cheerful candor. He replied, “I suppose,\r\n",
      "then, that I may enter into the subject with Mrs. Casaubon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Precisely; that is what she expressly desires. Her decision, she says,\r\n",
      "will much depend on what you can tell her. But not at present: she is,\r\n",
      "I believe, just setting out on a journey. I have her letter here,” said\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode, drawing it out, and reading from it. “‘I am immediately\r\n",
      "otherwise engaged,’ she says. ‘I am going into Yorkshire with Sir James\r\n",
      "and Lady Chettam; and the conclusions I come to about some land which I\r\n",
      "am to see there may affect my power of contributing to the Hospital.’\r\n",
      "Thus, Mr. Lydgate, there is no haste necessary in this matter; but I\r\n",
      "wished to apprise you beforehand of what may possibly occur.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode returned the letter to his side-pocket, and changed his\r\n",
      "attitude as if his business were closed. Lydgate, whose renewed hope\r\n",
      "about the Hospital only made him more conscious of the facts which\r\n",
      "poisoned his hope, felt that his effort after help, if made at all,\r\n",
      "must be made now and vigorously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am much obliged to you for giving me full notice,” he said, with a\r\n",
      "firm intention in his tone, yet with an interruptedness in his delivery\r\n",
      "which showed that he spoke unwillingly. “The highest object to me is my\r\n",
      "profession, and I had identified the Hospital with the best use I can\r\n",
      "at present make of my profession. But the best use is not always the\r\n",
      "same with monetary success. Everything which has made the Hospital\r\n",
      "unpopular has helped with other causes—I think they are all connected\r\n",
      "with my professional zeal—to make me unpopular as a practitioner. I get\r\n",
      "chiefly patients who can’t pay me. I should like them best, if I had\r\n",
      "nobody to pay on my own side.” Lydgate waited a little, but Bulstrode\r\n",
      "only bowed, looking at him fixedly, and he went on with the same\r\n",
      "interrupted enunciation—as if he were biting an objectional leek.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have slipped into money difficulties which I can see no way out of,\r\n",
      "unless some one who trusts me and my future will advance me a sum\r\n",
      "without other security. I had very little fortune left when I came\r\n",
      "here. I have no prospects of money from my own family. My expenses, in\r\n",
      "consequence of my marriage, have been very much greater than I had\r\n",
      "expected. The result at this moment is that it would take a thousand\r\n",
      "pounds to clear me. I mean, to free me from the risk of having all my\r\n",
      "goods sold in security of my largest debt—as well as to pay my other\r\n",
      "debts—and leave anything to keep us a little beforehand with our small\r\n",
      "income. I find that it is out of the question that my wife’s father\r\n",
      "should make such an advance. That is why I mention my position to—to\r\n",

      "with my prosperity or ruin.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate hated to hear himself. But he had spoken now, and had spoken\r\n",
      "with unmistakable directness. Mr. Bulstrode replied without haste, but\r\n",
      "also without hesitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am grieved, though, I confess, not surprised by this information,\r\n",

      "which has already been much indebted to me for sustainment in its\r\n",
      "present position. My advice to you, Mr. Lydgate, would be, that instead\r\n",
      "of involving yourself in further obligations, and continuing a doubtful\r\n",
      "struggle, you should simply become a bankrupt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "with his friend’s pleasure in entertaining a man who had been\r\n",
      "serviceable to him, and who had not had all his earnings. There was a\r\n",
      "cunning calculation under this noisy joking—a cool resolve to extract\r\n",
      "something the handsomer from Bulstrode as payment for release from this\r\n",
      "new application of torture. But his cunning had a little overcast its\r\n",
      "mark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode was indeed more tortured than the coarse fibre of Raffles\r\n",
      "could enable him to imagine. He had told his wife that he was simply\r\n",
      "taking care of this wretched creature, the victim of vice, who might\r\n",
      "otherwise injure himself; he implied, without the direct form of\r\n",
      "falsehood, that there was a family tie which bound him to this care,\r\n",
      "and that there were signs of mental alienation in Raffles which urged\r\n",
      "caution. He would himself drive the unfortunate being away the next\r\n",
      "morning. In these hints he felt that he was supplying Mrs. Bulstrode\r\n",
      "with precautionary information for his daughters and servants, and\r\n",
      "accounting for his allowing no one but himself to enter the room even\r\n",
      "with food and drink. But he sat in an agony of fear lest Raffles should\r\n",
      "be overheard in his loud and plain references to past facts—lest Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode should be even tempted to listen at the door. How could he\r\n",
      "hinder her, how betray his terror by opening the door to detect her?\r\n",
      "She was a woman of honest direct habits, and little likely to take so\r\n",
      "low a course in order to arrive at painful knowledge; but fear was\r\n",
      "stronger than the calculation of probabilities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this way Raffles had pushed the torture too far, and produced an\r\n",
      "effect which had not been in his plan. By showing himself hopelessly\r\n",
      "unmanageable he had made Bulstrode feel that a strong defiance was the\r\n",
      "only resource left. After taking Raffles to bed that night the banker\r\n",
      "ordered his closed carriage to be ready at half-past seven the next\r\n",
      "morning. At six o’clock he had already been long dressed, and had spent\r\n",
      "some of his wretchedness in prayer, pleading his motives for averting\r\n",
      "the worst evil if in anything he had used falsity and spoken what was\r\n",
      "not true before God. For Bulstrode shrank from a direct lie with an\r\n",
      "intensity disproportionate to the number of his more indirect misdeeds.\r\n",
      "But many of these misdeeds were like the subtle muscular movements\r\n",
      "which are not taken account of in the consciousness, though they bring\r\n",
      "about the end that we fix our mind on and desire. And it is only what\r\n",
      "we are vividly conscious of that we can vividly imagine to be seen by\r\n",
      "Omniscience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode carried his candle to the bedside of Raffles, who was\r\n",
      "apparently in a painful dream. He stood silent, hoping that the\r\n",
      "presence of the light would serve to waken the sleeper gradually and\r\n",
      "gently, for he feared some noise as the consequence of a too sudden\r\n",
      "awakening. He had watched for a couple of minutes or more the\r\n",
      "shudderings and pantings which seemed likely to end in waking, when\r\n",
      "Raffles, with a long half-stifled moan, started up and stared round him\r\n",
      "in terror, trembling and gasping. But he made no further noise, and\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, setting down the candle, awaited his recovery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a quarter of an hour later before Bulstrode, with a cold\r\n",
      "peremptoriness of manner which he had not before shown, said, “I came\r\n",
      "to call you thus early, Mr. Raffles, because I have ordered the\r\n",
      "carriage to be ready at half-past seven, and intend myself to conduct\r\n",
      "you as far as Ilsely, where you can either take the railway or await a\r\n",
      "coach.” Raffles was about to speak, but Bulstrode anticipated him\r\n",
      "imperiously with the words, “Be silent, sir, and hear what I have to\r\n",
      "say. I shall supply you with money now, and I will furnish you with a\r\n",
      "reasonable sum from time to time, on your application to me by letter;\r\n",
      "but if you choose to present yourself here again, if you return to\r\n",
      "Middlemarch, if you use your tongue in a manner injurious to me, you\r\n",
      "will have to live on such fruits as your malice can bring you, without\r\n",
      "help from me. Nobody will pay you well for blasting my name: I know the\r\n",
      "worst you can do against me, and I shall brave it if you dare to thrust\r\n",
      "yourself upon me again. Get up, sir, and do as I order you, without\r\n",
      "noise, or I will send for a policeman to take you off my premises, and\r\n",
      "you may carry your stories into every pothouse in the town, but you\r\n",
      "shall have no sixpence from me to pay your expenses there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode had rarely in his life spoken with such nervous energy: he\r\n",
      "had been deliberating on this speech and its probable effects through a\r\n",
      "large part of the night; and though he did not trust to its ultimately\r\n",
      "saving him from any return of Raffles, he had concluded that it was the\r\n",
      "best throw he could make. It succeeded in enforcing submission from the\r\n",
      "jaded man this morning: his empoisoned system at this moment quailed\r\n",
      "before Bulstrode’s cold, resolute bearing, and he was taken off quietly\r\n",
      "in the carriage before the family breakfast time. The servants imagined\r\n",
      "him to be a poor relation, and were not surprised that a strict man\r\n",
      "like their master, who held his head high in the world, should be\r\n",
      "ashamed of such a cousin and want to get rid of him. The banker’s drive\r\n",
      "of ten miles with his hated companion was a dreary beginning of the\r\n",
      "Christmas day; but at the end of the drive, Raffles had recovered his\r\n",
      "spirits, and parted in a contentment for which there was the good\r\n",
      "reason that the banker had given him a hundred pounds. Various motives\r\n",
      "urged Bulstrode to this open-handedness, but he did not himself inquire\r\n",
      "closely into all of them. As he had stood watching Raffles in his\r\n",
      "uneasy sleep, it had certainly entered his mind that the man had been\r\n",
      "much shattered since the first gift of two hundred pounds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had taken care to repeat the incisive statement of his resolve not\r\n",
      "to be played on any more; and had tried to penetrate Raffles with the\r\n",
      "fact that he had shown the risks of bribing him to be quite equal to\r\n",
      "the risks of defying him. But when, freed from his repulsive presence,\r\n",
      "Bulstrode returned to his quiet home, he brought with him no confidence\r\n",
      "that he had secured more than a respite. It was as if he had had a\r\n",
      "loathsome dream, and could not shake off its images with their hateful\r\n",
      "kindred of sensations—as if on all the pleasant surroundings of his\r\n",
      "life a dangerous reptile had left his slimy traces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Who can know how much of his most inward life is made up of the\r\n",
      "thoughts he believes other men to have about him, until that fabric of\r\n",
      "opinion is threatened with ruin?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit of\r\n",
      "uneasy presentiment in his wife’s mind, because she carefully avoided\r\n",
      "any allusion to it. He had been used every day to taste the flavor of\r\n",
      "supremacy and the tribute of complete deference: and the certainty that\r\n",
      "he was watched or measured with a hidden suspicion of his having some\r\n",
      "discreditable secret, made his voice totter when he was speaking to\r\n",
      "edification. Foreseeing, to men of Bulstrode’s anxious temperament, is\r\n",
      "often worse than seeing; and his imagination continually heightened the\r\n",
      "anguish of an imminent disgrace. Yes, imminent; for if his defiance of\r\n",
      "Raffles did not keep the man away—and though he prayed for this result\r\n",
      "he hardly hoped for it—the disgrace was certain. In vain he said to\r\n",
      "himself that, if permitted, it would be a divine visitation, a\r\n",
      "chastisement, a preparation; he recoiled from the imagined burning; and\r\n",
      "he judged that it must be more for the Divine glory that he should\r\n",
      "escape dishonor. That recoil had at last urged him to make preparations\r\n",
      "for quitting Middlemarch. If evil truth must be reported of him, he\r\n",
      "would then be at a less scorching distance from the contempt of his old\r\n",
      "neighbors; and in a new scene, where his life would not have gathered\r\n",
      "the same wide sensibility, the tormentor, if he pursued him, would be\r\n",
      "less formidable. To leave the place finally would, he knew, be\r\n",
      "extremely painful to his wife, and on other grounds he would have\r\n",
      "preferred to stay where he had struck root. Hence he made his\r\n",
      "preparations at first in a conditional way, wishing to leave on all\r\n",
      "sides an opening for his return after brief absence, if any favorable\r\n",
      "intervention of Providence should dissipate his fears. He was preparing\r\n",
      "to transfer his management of the Bank, and to give up any active\r\n",
      "control of other commercial affairs in the neighborhood, on the ground\r\n",
      "of his failing health, but without excluding his future resumption of\r\n",
      "such work. The measure would cause him some added expense and some\r\n",
      "diminution of income beyond what he had already undergone from the\r\n",
      "general depression of trade; and the Hospital presented itself as a\r\n",
      "principal object of outlay on which he could fairly economize.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the experience which had determined his conversation with\r\n",
      "Lydgate. But at this time his arrangements had most of them gone no\r\n",
      "farther than a stage at which he could recall them if they proved to be\r\n",
      "unnecessary. He continually deferred the final steps; in the midst of\r\n",
      "his fears, like many a man who is in danger of shipwreck or of being\r\n",
      "dashed from his carriage by runaway horses, he had a clinging\r\n",
      "impression that something would happen to hinder the worst, and that to\r\n",
      "spoil his life by a late transplantation might be over-hasty—especially\r\n",
      "since it was difficult to account satisfactorily to his wife for the\r\n",
      "project of their indefinite exile from the only place where she would\r\n",
      "like to live.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among the affairs Bulstrode had to care for, was the management of the\r\n",
      "farm at Stone Court in case of his absence; and on this as well as on\r\n",
      "all other matters connected with any houses and land he possessed in or\r\n",
      "about Middlemarch, he had consulted Caleb Garth. Like every one else\r\n",
      "who had business of that sort, he wanted to get the agent who was more\r\n",
      "anxious for his employer’s interests than his own. With regard to Stone\r\n",
      "Court, since Bulstrode wished to retain his hold on the stock, and to\r\n",
      "have an arrangement by which he himself could, if he chose, resume his\r\n",
      "favorite recreation of superintendence, Caleb had advised him not to\r\n",
      "trust to a mere bailiff, but to let the land, stock, and implements\r\n",
      "yearly, and take a proportionate share of the proceeds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I trust to you to find me a tenant on these terms, Mr. Garth?”\r\n",
      "said Bulstrode. “And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would\r\n",
      "repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll think about it,” said Caleb, in his blunt way. “I’ll see how I\r\n",
      "can make it out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If it had not been that he had to consider Fred Vincy’s future, Mr.\r\n",
      "Garth would not probably have been glad of any addition to his work, of\r\n",
      "which his wife was always fearing an excess for him as he grew older.\r\n",
      "But on quitting Bulstrode after that conversation, a very alluring idea\r\n",
      "occurred to him about this said letting of Stone Court. What if\r\n",
      "Bulstrode would agree to his placing Fred Vincy there on the\r\n",
      "understanding that he, Caleb Garth, should be responsible for the\r\n",
      "management? It would be an excellent schooling for Fred; he might make\r\n",
      "a modest income there, and still have time left to get knowledge by\r\n",
      "helping in other business. He mentioned his notion to Mrs. Garth with\r\n",
      "such evident delight that she could not bear to chill his pleasure by\r\n",
      "expressing her constant fear of his undertaking too much.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The lad would be as happy as two,” he said, throwing himself back in\r\n",
      "his chair, and looking radiant, “if I could tell him it was all\r\n",
      "settled. Think; Susan! His mind had been running on that place for\r\n",
      "years before old Featherstone died. And it would be as pretty a turn of\r\n",
      "things as could be that he should hold the place in a good industrious\r\n",
      "way after all—by his taking to business. For it’s likely enough\r\n",
      "Bulstrode might let him go on, and gradually buy the stock. He hasn’t\r\n",
      "made up his mind, I can see, whether or not he shall settle somewhere\r\n",
      "else as a lasting thing. I never was better pleased with a notion in my\r\n",
      "life. And then the children might be married by-and-by, Susan.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will not give any hint of the plan to Fred, until you are sure\r\n",
      "that Bulstrode would agree to the plan?” said Mrs. Garth, in a tone of\r\n",
      "gentle caution. “And as to marriage, Caleb, we old people need not help\r\n",
      "to hasten it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I don’t know,” said Caleb, swinging his head aside. “Marriage is a\r\n",
      "taming thing. Fred would want less of my bit and bridle. However, I\r\n",
      "shall say nothing till I know the ground I’m treading on. I shall speak\r\n",
      "to Bulstrode again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took his earliest opportunity of doing so. Bulstrode had anything\r\n",
      "but a warm interest in his nephew Fred Vincy, but he had a strong wish\r\n",
      "to secure Mr. Garth’s services on many scattered points of business at\r\n",
      "which he was sure to be a considerable loser, if they were under less\r\n",
      "conscientious management. On that ground he made no objection to Mr.\r\n",
      "Garth’s proposal; and there was also another reason why he was not\r\n",
      "sorry to give a consent which was to benefit one of the Vincy family.\r\n",
      "It was that Mrs. Bulstrode, having heard of Lydgate’s debts, had been\r\n",
      "anxious to know whether her husband could not do something for poor\r\n",
      "Rosamond, and had been much troubled on learning from him that\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s affairs were not easily remediable, and that the wisest plan\r\n",
      "was to let them “take their course.” Mrs. Bulstrode had then said for\r\n",
      "the first time, “I think you are always a little hard towards my\r\n",
      "family, Nicholas. And I am sure I have no reason to deny any of my\r\n",
      "relatives. Too worldly they may be, but no one ever had to say that\r\n",
      "they were not respectable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Harriet,” said Mr. Bulstrode, wincing under his wife’s eyes,\r\n",
      "which were filling with tears, “I have supplied your brother with a\r\n",
      "great deal of capital. I cannot be expected to take care of his married\r\n",
      "children.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That seemed to be true, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s remonstrance subsided into\r\n",
      "pity for poor Rosamond, whose extravagant education she had always\r\n",
      "foreseen the fruits of.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But remembering that dialogue, Mr. Bulstrode felt that when he had to\r\n",
      "talk to his wife fully about his plan of quitting Middlemarch, he\r\n",
      "should be glad to tell her that he had made an arrangement which might\r\n",
      "be for the good of her nephew Fred. At present he had merely mentioned\r\n",
      "to her that he thought of shutting up The Shrubs for a few months, and\r\n",
      "taking a house on the Southern Coast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hence Mr. Garth got the assurance he desired, namely, that in case of\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s departure from Middlemarch for an indefinite time, Fred\r\n",
      "Vincy should be allowed to have the tenancy of Stone Court on the terms\r\n",
      "proposed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Caleb was so elated with his hope of this “neat turn” being given to\r\n",
      "things, that if his self-control had not been braced by a little\r\n",
      "affectionate wifely scolding, he would have betrayed everything to\r\n",
      "Mary, wanting “to give the child comfort.” However, he restrained\r\n",
      "himself, and kept in strict privacy from Fred certain visits which he\r\n",
      "was making to Stone Court, in order to look more thoroughly into the\r\n",
      "state of the land and stock, and take a preliminary estimate. He was\r\n",
      "certainly more eager in these visits than the probable speed of events\r\n",
      "required him to be; but he was stimulated by a fatherly delight in\r\n",
      "occupying his mind with this bit of probable happiness which he held in\r\n",
      "store like a hidden birthday gift for Fred and Mary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But suppose the whole scheme should turn out to be a castle in the\r\n",
      "air?” said Mrs. Garth.\r\n",

      "three o’clock of the same day on which he had received Lydgate there,\r\n",

      "were sharing some thought which filled his large quiet brow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode, like every one else who knew Caleb, was used to his\r\n",
      "slowness in beginning to speak on any topic which he felt to be\r\n",
      "important, and rather expected that he was about to recur to the buying\r\n",
      "of some houses in Blindman’s Court, for the sake of pulling them down,\r\n",
      "as a sacrifice of property which would be well repaid by the influx of\r\n",
      "air and light on that spot. It was by propositions of this kind that\r\n",
      "Caleb was sometimes troublesome to his employers; but he had usually\r\n",
      "found Bulstrode ready to meet him in projects of improvement, and they\r\n",
      "had got on well together. When he spoke again, however, it was to say,\r\n",
      "in rather a subdued voice—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have just come away from Stone Court, Mr. Bulstrode.”\r\n",

      "myself yesterday. Abel has done well with the lambs this year.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, yes,” said Caleb, looking up gravely, “there is something wrong—a\r\n",
      "stranger, who is very ill, I think. He wants a doctor, and I came to\r\n",
      "tell you of that. His name is Raffles.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He saw the shock of his words passing through Bulstrode’s frame. On\r\n",
      "this subject the banker had thought that his fears were too constantly\r\n",
      "on the watch to be taken by surprise; but he had been mistaken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor wretch!” he said in a compassionate tone, though his lips\r\n",
      "trembled a little. “Do you know how he came there?”\r\n",

      "“I took him myself,” said Caleb, quietly—“took him up in my gig. He had\r\n",
      "got down from the coach, and was walking a little beyond the turning\r\n",
      "from the toll-house, and I overtook him. He remembered seeing me with\r\n",
      "you once before, at Stone Court, and he asked me to take him on. I saw\r\n",
      "he was ill: it seemed to me the right thing to do, to carry him under\r\n",
      "shelter. And now I think you should lose no time in getting advice for\r\n",

      "Lydgate’s as you pass—or stay! he may at this hour probably be at the\r\n",
      "Hospital. I will first send my man on the horse there with a note this\r\n",
      "instant, and then I will myself ride to Stone Court.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode quickly wrote a note, and went out himself to give the\r\n",
      "commission to his man. When he returned, Caleb was standing as before\r\n",
      "with one hand on the back of the chair, holding his hat with the other.\r\n",
      "In Bulstrode’s mind the dominant thought was, “Perhaps Raffles only\r\n",
      "spoke to Garth of his illness. Garth may wonder, as he must have done\r\n",
      "before, at this disreputable fellow’s claiming intimacy with me; but he\r\n",
      "will know nothing. And he is friendly to me—I can be of use to him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He longed for some confirmation of this hopeful conjecture, but to have\r\n",
      "asked any question as to what Raffles had said or done would have been\r\n",
      "to betray fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Garth,” he said, in his usual\r\n",
      "tone of politeness. “My servant will be back in a few minutes, and I\r\n",
      "shall then go myself to see what can be done for this unfortunate man.\r\n",
      "Perhaps you had some other business with me? If so, pray be seated.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Caleb, making a slight gesture with his right hand to\r\n",
      "waive the invitation. “I wish to say, Mr. Bulstrode, that I must\r\n",
      "request you to put your business into some other hands than mine. I am\r\n",
      "obliged to you for your handsome way of meeting me—about the letting of\r\n",
      "Stone Court, and all other business. But I must give it up.” A sharp\r\n",
      "certainty entered like a stab into Bulstrode’s soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is sudden, Mr. Garth,” was all he could say at first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is,” said Caleb; “but it is quite fixed. I must give it up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He spoke with a firmness which was very gentle, and yet he could see\r\n",
      "that Bulstrode seemed to cower under that gentleness, his face looking\r\n",
      "dried and his eyes swerving away from the glance which rested on him.\r\n",
      "Caleb felt a deep pity for him, but he could have used no pretexts to\r\n",
      "account for his resolve, even if they would have been of any use.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have been led to this, I apprehend, by some slanders concerning me\r\n",
      "uttered by that unhappy creature,” said Bulstrode, anxious now to know\r\n",
      "the utmost.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is true. I can’t deny that I act upon what I heard from him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a conscientious man, Mr. Garth—a man, I trust, who feels\r\n",
      "himself accountable to God. You would not wish to injure me by being\r\n",
      "too ready to believe a slander,” said Bulstrode, casting about for\r\n",
      "pleas that might be adapted to his hearer’s mind. “That is a poor\r\n",
      "reason for giving up a connection which I think I may say will be\r\n",
      "mutually beneficial.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I would injure no man if I could help it,” said Caleb; “even if I\r\n",
      "thought God winked at it. I hope I should have a feeling for my\r\n",
      "fellow-creature. But, sir—I am obliged to believe that this Raffles has\r\n",
      "told me the truth. And I can’t be happy in working with you, or\r\n",
      "profiting by you. It hurts my mind. I must beg you to seek another\r\n",
      "agent.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well, Mr. Garth. But I must at least claim to know the worst that\r\n",
      "he has told you. I must know what is the foul speech that I am liable\r\n",
      "to be the victim of,” said Bulstrode, a certain amount of anger\r\n",
      "beginning to mingle with his humiliation before this quiet man who\r\n",
      "renounced his benefits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s needless,” said Caleb, waving his hand, bowing his head\r\n",
      "slightly, and not swerving from the tone which had in it the merciful\r\n",
      "intention to spare this pitiable man. “What he has said to me will\r\n",
      "never pass from my lips, unless something now unknown forces it from\r\n",
      "me. If you led a harmful life for gain, and kept others out of their\r\n",
      "rights by deceit, to get the more for yourself, I dare say you\r\n",
      "repent—you would like to go back, and can’t: that must be a bitter\r\n",
      "thing”—Caleb paused a moment and shook his head—“it is not for me to\r\n",
      "make your life harder to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you do—you do make it harder to me,” said Bulstrode constrained\r\n",
      "into a genuine, pleading cry. “You make it harder to me by turning your\r\n",
      "back on me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That I’m forced to do,” said Caleb, still more gently, lifting up his\r\n",
      "hand. “I am sorry. I don’t judge you and say, he is wicked, and I am\r\n",
      "righteous. God forbid. I don’t know everything. A man may do wrong, and\r\n",
      "his will may rise clear out of it, though he can’t get his life clear.\r\n",
      "That’s a bad punishment. If it is so with you,—well, I’m very sorry for\r\n",
      "you. But I have that feeling inside me, that I can’t go on working with\r\n",
      "you. That’s all, Mr. Bulstrode. Everything else is buried, so far as my\r\n",
      "will goes. And I wish you good-day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One moment, Mr. Garth!” said Bulstrode, hurriedly. “I may trust then\r\n",
      "to your solemn assurance that you will not repeat either to man or\r\n",
      "woman what—even if it have any degree of truth in it—is yet a malicious\r\n",
      "representation?” Caleb’s wrath was stirred, and he said, indignantly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should I have said it if I didn’t mean it? I am in no fear of you.\r\n",
      "Such tales as that will never tempt my tongue.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me—I am agitated—I am the victim of this abandoned man.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stop a bit! you have got to consider whether you didn’t help to make\r\n",
      "him worse, when you profited by his vices.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are wronging me by too readily believing him,” said Bulstrode,\r\n",
      "oppressed, as by a nightmare, with the inability to deny flatly what\r\n",
      "Raffles might have said; and yet feeling it an escape that Caleb had\r\n",
      "not so stated it to him as to ask for that flat denial.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Caleb, lifting his hand deprecatingly; “I am ready to\r\n",
      "believe better, when better is proved. I rob you of no good chance. As\r\n",
      "to speaking, I hold it a crime to expose a man’s sin unless I’m clear\r\n",
      "it must be done to save the innocent. That is my way of thinking, Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, and what I say, I’ve no need to swear. I wish you good-day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some hours later, when he was at home, Caleb said to his wife,\r\n",
      "incidentally, that he had had some little differences with Bulstrode,\r\n",
      "and that in consequence, he had given up all notion of taking Stone\r\n",
      "Court, and indeed had resigned doing further business for him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?” said Mrs. Garth,\r\n",
      "imagining that her husband had been touched on his sensitive point, and\r\n",
      "not been allowed to do what he thought right as to materials and modes\r\n",
      "of work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh,” said Caleb, bowing his head and waving his hand gravely. And Mrs.\r\n",
      "Garth knew that this was a sign of his not intending to speak further\r\n",
      "on the subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Bulstrode, he had almost immediately mounted his horse and set\r\n",
      "off for Stone Court, being anxious to arrive there before Lydgate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His mind was crowded with images and conjectures, which were a language\r\n",
      "to his hopes and fears, just as we hear tones from the vibrations which\r\n",
      "shake our whole system. The deep humiliation with which he had winced\r\n",
      "under Caleb Garth’s knowledge of his past and rejection of his\r\n",
      "patronage, alternated with and almost gave way to the sense of safety\r\n",
      "in the fact that Garth, and no other, had been the man to whom Raffles\r\n",
      "had spoken. It seemed to him a sort of earnest that Providence intended\r\n",
      "his rescue from worse consequences; the way being thus left open for\r\n",
      "the hope of secrecy. That Raffles should be afflicted with illness,\r\n",
      "that he should have been led to Stone Court rather than\r\n",
      "elsewhere—Bulstrode’s heart fluttered at the vision of probabilities\r\n",
      "which these events conjured up. If it should turn out that he was freed\r\n",
      "from all danger of disgrace—if he could breathe in perfect liberty—his\r\n",
      "life should be more consecrated than it had ever been before. He\r\n",
      "mentally lifted up this vow as if it would urge the result he longed\r\n",
      "for—he tried to believe in the potency of that prayerful resolution—its\r\n",
      "potency to determine death. He knew that he ought to say, “Thy will be\r\n",
      "done;” and he said it often. But the intense desire remained that the\r\n",
      "will of God might be the death of that hated man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet when he arrived at Stone Court he could not see the change in\r\n",
      "Raffles without a shock. But for his pallor and feebleness, Bulstrode\r\n",
      "would have called the change in him entirely mental. Instead of his\r\n",
      "loud tormenting mood, he showed an intense, vague terror, and seemed to\r\n",
      "deprecate Bulstrode’s anger, because the money was all gone—he had been\r\n",
      "robbed—it had half of it been taken from him. He had only come here\r\n",
      "because he was ill and somebody was hunting him—somebody was after him,\r\n",
      "he had told nobody anything, he had kept his mouth shut. Bulstrode, not\r\n",
      "knowing the significance of these symptoms, interpreted this new\r\n",
      "nervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into true\r\n",
      "confessions, and taxed him with falsehood in saying that he had not\r\n",
      "told anything, since he had just told the man who took him up in his\r\n",
      "gig and brought him to Stone Court. Raffles denied this with solemn\r\n",
      "adjurations; the fact being that the links of consciousness were\r\n",
      "interrupted in him, and that his minute terror-stricken narrative to\r\n",
      "Caleb Garth had been delivered under a set of visionary impulses which\r\n",
      "had dropped back into darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s heart sank again at this sign that he could get no grasp\r\n",
      "over the wretched man’s mind, and that no word of Raffles could be\r\n",
      "trusted as to the fact which he most wanted to know, namely, whether or\r\n",
      "not he had really kept silence to every one in the neighborhood except\r\n",
      "Caleb Garth. The housekeeper had told him without the least constraint\r\n",
      "of manner that since Mr. Garth left, Raffles had asked her for beer,\r\n",
      "and after that had not spoken, seeming very ill. On that side it might\r\n",
      "be concluded that there had been no betrayal. Mrs. Abel thought, like\r\n",
      "the servants at The Shrubs, that the strange man belonged to the\r\n",
      "unpleasant “kin” who are among the troubles of the rich; she had at\r\n",
      "first referred the kinship to Mr. Rigg, and where there was property\r\n",
      "left, the buzzing presence of such large blue-bottles seemed natural\r\n",
      "enough. How he could be “kin” to Bulstrode as well was not so clear,\r\n",
      "but Mrs. Abel agreed with her husband that there was “no knowing,” a\r\n",
      "proposition which had a great deal of mental food for her, so that she\r\n",
      "shook her head over it without further speculation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In less than an hour Lydgate arrived. Bulstrode met him outside the\r\n",
      "wainscoted parlor, where Raffles was, and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have called you in, Mr. Lydgate, to an unfortunate man who was once\r\n",
      "in my employment, many years ago. Afterwards he went to America, and\r\n",
      "returned I fear to an idle dissolute life. Being destitute, he has a\r\n",
      "claim on me. He was slightly connected with Rigg, the former owner of\r\n",
      "this place, and in consequence found his way here. I believe he is\r\n",
      "seriously ill: apparently his mind is affected. I feel bound to do the\r\n",
      "utmost for him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate, who had the remembrance of his last conversation with\r\n",
      "Bulstrode strongly upon him, was not disposed to say an unnecessary\r\n",
      "word to him, and bowed slightly in answer to this account; but just\r\n",
      "before entering the room he turned automatically and said, “What is his\r\n",
      "name?”—to know names being as much a part of the medical man’s\r\n",
      "accomplishment as of the practical politician’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Raffles, John Raffles,” said Bulstrode, who hoped that whatever became\r\n",
      "of Raffles, Lydgate would never know any more of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had thoroughly examined and considered the patient, Lydgate\r\n",
      "ordered that he should go to bed, and be kept there in as complete\r\n",
      "quiet as possible, and then went with Bulstrode into another room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a serious case, I apprehend,” said the banker, before Lydgate\r\n",
      "began to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No—and yes,” said Lydgate, half dubiously. “It is difficult to decide\r\n",
      "as to the possible effect of long-standing complications; but the man\r\n",
      "had a robust constitution to begin with. I should not expect this\r\n",
      "attack to be fatal, though of course the system is in a ticklish state.\r\n",
      "He should be well watched and attended to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will remain here myself,” said Bulstrode. “Mrs. Abel and her husband\r\n",
      "are inexperienced. I can easily remain here for the night, if you will\r\n",
      "oblige me by taking a note for Mrs. Bulstrode.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should think that is hardly necessary,” said Lydgate. “He seems tame\r\n",
      "and terrified enough. He might become more unmanageable. But there is a\r\n",
      "man here—is there not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have more than once stayed here a few nights for the sake of\r\n",
      "seclusion,” said Bulstrode, indifferently; “I am quite disposed to do\r\n",
      "so now. Mrs. Abel and her husband can relieve or aid me, if necessary.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well. Then I need give my directions only to you,” said Lydgate,\r\n",
      "not feeling surprised at a little peculiarity in Bulstrode.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You think, then, that the case is hopeful?” said Bulstrode, when\r\n",
      "Lydgate had ended giving his orders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Unless there turn out to be further complications, such as I have not\r\n",
      "at present detected—yes,” said Lydgate. “He may pass on to a worse\r\n",
      "stage; but I should not wonder if he got better in a few days, by\r\n",
      "adhering to the treatment I have prescribed. There must be firmness.\r\n",
      "Remember, if he calls for liquors of any sort, not to give them to him.\r\n",
      "In my opinion, men in his condition are oftener killed by treatment\r\n",
      "than by the disease. Still, new symptoms may arise. I shall come again\r\n",
      "to-morrow morning.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After waiting for the note to be carried to Mrs. Bulstrode, Lydgate\r\n",
      "rode away, forming no conjectures, in the first instance, about the\r\n",
      "history of Raffles, but rehearsing the whole argument, which had lately\r\n",
      "been much stirred by the publication of Dr. Ware’s abundant experience\r\n",
      "in America, as to the right way of treating cases of alcoholic\r\n",
      "poisoning such as this. Lydgate, when abroad, had already been\r\n",
      "interested in this question: he was strongly convinced against the\r\n",
      "prevalent practice of allowing alcohol and persistently administering\r\n",
      "large doses of opium; and he had repeatedly acted on this conviction\r\n",
      "with a favorable result.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The man is in a diseased state,” he thought, “but there’s a good deal\r\n",
      "of wear in him still. I suppose he is an object of charity to\r\n",
      "Bulstrode. It is curious what patches of hardness and tenderness lie\r\n",
      "side by side in men’s dispositions. Bulstrode seems the most\r\n",
      "unsympathetic fellow I ever saw about some people, and yet he has taken\r\n",
      "no end of trouble, and spent a great deal of money, on benevolent\r\n",
      "objects. I suppose he has some test by which he finds out whom Heaven\r\n",
      "cares for—he has made up his mind that it doesn’t care for me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This streak of bitterness came from a plenteous source, and kept\r\n",
      "widening in the current of his thought as he neared Lowick Gate. He had\r\n",
      "not been there since his first interview with Bulstrode in the morning,\r\n",
      "having been found at the Hospital by the banker’s messenger; and for\r\n",
      "the first time he was returning to his home without the vision of any\r\n",
      "expedient in the background which left him a hope of raising money\r\n",
      "enough to deliver him from the coming destitution of everything which\r\n",
      "made his married life tolerable—everything which saved him and Rosamond\r\n",
      "from that bare isolation in which they would be forced to recognize how\r\n",
      "little of a comfort they could be to each other. It was more bearable\r\n",
      "to do without tenderness for himself than to see that his own\r\n",
      "tenderness could make no amends for the lack of other things to her.\r\n",
      "The sufferings of his own pride from humiliations past and to come were\r\n",
      "keen enough, yet they were hardly distinguishable to himself from that\r\n",
      "more acute pain which dominated them—the pain of foreseeing that\r\n",
      "Rosamond would come to regard him chiefly as the cause of\r\n",
      "disappointment and unhappiness to her. He had never liked the\r\n",
      "makeshifts of poverty, and they had never before entered into his\r\n",
      "prospects for himself; but he was beginning now to imagine how two\r\n",
      "creatures who loved each other, and had a stock of thoughts in common,\r\n",
      "might laugh over their shabby furniture, and their calculations how far\r\n",
      "they could afford butter and eggs. But the glimpse of that poetry\r\n",
      "seemed as far off from him as the carelessness of the golden age; in\r\n",
      "poor Rosamond’s mind there was not room enough for luxuries to look\r\n",
      "small in. He got down from his horse in a very sad mood, and went into\r\n",
      "the house, not expecting to be cheered except by his dinner, and\r\n",
      "reflecting that before the evening closed it would be wise to tell\r\n",
      "Rosamond of his application to Bulstrode and its failure. It would be\r\n",
      "well not to lose time in preparing her for the worst.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his dinner waited long for him before he was able to eat it. For on\r\n",
      "entering he found that Dover’s agent had already put a man in the\r\n",
      "house, and when he asked where Mrs. Lydgate was, he was told that she\r\n",
      "was in her bedroom. He went up and found her stretched on the bed pale\r\n",
      "and silent, without an answer even in her face to any word or look of\r\n",
      "his. He sat down by the bed and leaning over her said with almost a cry\r\n",
      "of prayer—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Forgive me for this misery, my poor Rosamond! Let us only love one\r\n",
      "another.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked at him silently, still with the blank despair on her face;\r\n",
      "but then the tears began to fill her blue eyes, and her lip trembled.\r\n",
      "The strong man had had too much to bear that day. He let his head fall\r\n",
      "beside hers and sobbed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not hinder her from going to her father early in the morning—it\r\n",
      "seemed now that he ought not to hinder her from doing as she pleased.\r\n",
      "In half an hour she came back, and said that papa and mamma wished her\r\n",
      "to go and stay with them while things were in this miserable state.\r\n",
      "Papa said he could do nothing about the debt—if he paid this, there\r\n",
      "would be half-a-dozen more. She had better come back home again till\r\n",
      "Lydgate had got a comfortable home for her. “Do you object, Tertius?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do as you like,” said Lydgate. “But things are not coming to a crisis\r\n",
      "immediately. There is no hurry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "difficult night and morning, while he had the air of an animated corpse\r\n",

      "of what had taken place between them the morning before was accompanied\r\n",
      "with sensibilities which had not been roused at all during the actual\r\n",
      "scene. He had then cared but little about Lydgate’s painful impressions\r\n",
      "with regard to the suggested change in the Hospital, or about the\r\n",
      "disposition towards himself which what he held to be his justifiable\r\n",
      "refusal of a rather exorbitant request might call forth. He recurred to\r\n",
      "the scene now with a perception that he had probably made Lydgate his\r\n",
      "enemy, and with an awakened desire to propitiate him, or rather to\r\n",
      "create in him a strong sense of personal obligation. He regretted that\r\n",
      "he had not at once made even an unreasonable money-sacrifice. For in\r\n",
      "case of unpleasant suspicions, or even knowledge gathered from the\r\n",
      "raving of Raffles, Bulstrode would have felt that he had a defence in\r\n",

      "shattered looks were noticed by Balstrode. But he immediately threw\r\n",
      "himself into the consideration of the patient, and inquired strictly\r\n",
      "into all that had occurred. Raffles was worse, would take hardly any\r\n",
      "food, was persistently wakeful and restlessly raving; but still not\r\n",
      "violent. Contrary to Bulstrode’s alarmed expectation, he took little\r\n",
      "notice of Lydgate’s presence, and continued to talk or murmur\r\n",
      "incoherently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you think of him?” said Bulstrode, in private.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You are less hopeful?”\r\n",

      "which made him uneasy, though in reality it was not due to any\r\n",
      "suspicious conjecture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I think so,” said Bulstrode, governing himself and speaking with\r\n",
      "deliberation. “Mrs. Bulstrode is advised of the reasons which detain\r\n",
      "me. Mrs. Abel and her husband are not experienced enough to be left\r\n",
      "quite alone, and this kind of responsibility is scarcely included in\r\n",
      "their service of me. You have some fresh instructions, I presume.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chief new instruction that Lydgate had to give was on the\r\n",
      "administration of extremely moderate doses of opium, in case of the\r\n",
      "sleeplessness continuing after several hours. He had taken the\r\n",
      "precaution of bringing opium in his pocket, and he gave minute\r\n",
      "directions to Bulstrode as to the doses, and the point at which they\r\n",
      "should cease. He insisted on the risk of not ceasing; and repeated his\r\n",
      "order that no alcohol should be given.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From what I see of the case,” he ended, “narcotism is the only thing I\r\n",
      "should be much afraid of. He may wear through even without much food.\r\n",
      "There’s a good deal of strength in him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You look ill yourself, Mr. Lydgate—a most unusual, I may say\r\n",
      "unprecedented thing in my knowledge of you,” said Bulstrode, showing a\r\n",
      "solicitude as unlike his indifference the day before, as his present\r\n",
      "recklessness about his own fatigue was unlike his habitual\r\n",
      "self-cherishing anxiety. “I fear you are harassed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I am,” said Lydgate, brusquely, holding his hat, and ready to go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Something new, I fear,” said Bulstrode, inquiringly. “Pray be seated.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, thank you,” said Lydgate, with some hauteur. “I mentioned to you\r\n",
      "yesterday what was the state of my affairs. There is nothing to add,\r\n",
      "except that the execution has since then been actually put into my\r\n",
      "house. One can tell a good deal of trouble in a short sentence. I will\r\n",
      "say good morning.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stay, Mr. Lydgate, stay,” said Bulstrode; “I have been reconsidering\r\n",
      "this subject. I was yesterday taken by surprise, and saw it\r\n",
      "superficially. Mrs. Bulstrode is anxious for her niece, and I myself\r\n",
      "should grieve at a calamitous change in your position. Claims on me are\r\n",
      "numerous, but on reconsideration, I esteem it right that I should incur\r\n",
      "a small sacrifice rather than leave you unaided. You said, I think,\r\n",
      "that a thousand pounds would suffice entirely to free you from your\r\n",
      "burthens, and enable you to recover a firm stand?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Lydgate, a great leap of joy within him surmounting every\r\n",
      "other feeling; “that would pay all my debts, and leave me a little on\r\n",
      "hand. I could set about economizing in our way of living. And by-and-by\r\n",
      "my practice might look up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you will wait a moment, Mr. Lydgate, I will draw a check to that\r\n",
      "amount. I am aware that help, to be effectual in these cases, should be\r\n",
      "thorough.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While Bulstrode wrote, Lydgate turned to the window thinking of his\r\n",
      "home—thinking of his life with its good start saved from frustration,\r\n",
      "its good purposes still unbroken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can give me a note of hand for this, Mr. Lydgate,” said the\r\n",
      "banker, advancing towards him with the check. “And by-and-by, I hope,\r\n",
      "you may be in circumstances gradually to repay me. Meanwhile, I have\r\n",
      "pleasure in thinking that you will be released from further\r\n",
      "difficulty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am deeply obliged to you,” said Lydgate. “You have restored to me\r\n",
      "the prospect of working with some happiness and some chance of good.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It appeared to him a very natural movement in Bulstrode that he should\r\n",
      "have reconsidered his refusal: it corresponded with the more munificent\r\n",
      "side of his character. But as he put his hack into a canter, that he\r\n",
      "might get the sooner home, and tell the good news to Rosamond, and get\r\n",
      "cash at the bank to pay over to Dover’s agent, there crossed his mind,\r\n",
      "with an unpleasant impression, as from a dark-winged flight of evil\r\n",
      "augury across his vision, the thought of that contrast in himself which\r\n",
      "a few months had brought—that he should be overjoyed at being under a\r\n",
      "strong personal obligation—that he should be overjoyed at getting money\r\n",
      "for himself from Bulstrode.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The banker felt that he had done something to nullify one cause of\r\n",
      "uneasiness, and yet he was scarcely the easier. He did not measure the\r\n",
      "quantity of diseased motive which had made him wish for Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "good-will, but the quantity was none the less actively there, like an\r\n",
      "irritating agent in his blood. A man vows, and yet will not cast away\r\n",
      "the means of breaking his vow. Is it that he distinctly means to break\r\n",
      "it? Not at all; but the desires which tend to break it are at work in\r\n",
      "him dimly, and make their way into his imagination, and relax his\r\n",
      "muscles in the very moments when he is telling himself over again the\r\n",
      "reasons for his vow. Raffles, recovering quickly, returning to the free\r\n",
      "use of his odious powers—how could Bulstrode wish for that? Raffles\r\n",
      "dead was the image that brought release, and indirectly he prayed for\r\n",
      "that way of release, beseeching that, if it were possible, the rest of\r\n",
      "his days here below might be freed from the threat of an ignominy which\r\n",
      "would break him utterly as an instrument of God’s service. Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "opinion was not on the side of promise that this prayer would be\r\n",
      "fulfilled; and as the day advanced, Bulstrode felt himself getting\r\n",
      "irritated at the persistent life in this man, whom he would fain have\r\n",
      "seen sinking into the silence of death: imperious will stirred\r\n",
      "murderous impulses towards this brute life, over which will, by itself,\r\n",
      "had no power. He said inwardly that he was getting too much worn; he\r\n",
      "would not sit up with the patient to-night, but leave him to Mrs. Abel,\r\n",
      "who, if necessary, could call her husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At six o’clock, Raffles, having had only fitful perturbed snatches of\r\n",
      "sleep, from which he waked with fresh restlessness and perpetual cries\r\n",
      "that he was sinking away, Bulstrode began to administer the opium\r\n",
      "according to Lydgate’s directions. At the end of half an hour or more\r\n",
      "he called Mrs. Abel and told her that he found himself unfit for\r\n",
      "further watching. He must now consign the patient to her care; and he\r\n",
      "proceeded to repeat to her Lydgate’s directions as to the quantity of\r\n",
      "each dose. Mrs. Abel had not before known anything of Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "prescriptions; she had simply prepared and brought whatever Bulstrode\r\n",
      "ordered, and had done what he pointed out to her. She began now to ask\r\n",
      "what else she should do besides administering the opium.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing at present, except the offer of the soup or the soda-water:\r\n",
      "you can come to me for further directions. Unless there is any\r\n",
      "important change, I shall not come into the room again to-night. You\r\n",
      "will ask your husband for help if necessary. I must go to bed early.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ve much need, sir, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Abel, “and to take\r\n",
      "something more strengthening than what you’ve done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode went away now without anxiety as to what Raffles might say in\r\n",
      "his raving, which had taken on a muttering incoherence not likely to\r\n",
      "create any dangerous belief. At any rate he must risk this. He went\r\n",
      "down into the wainscoted parlor first, and began to consider whether he\r\n",
      "would not have his horse saddled and go home by the moonlight, and give\r\n",
      "up caring for earthly consequences. Then, he wished that he had begged\r\n",
      "Lydgate to come again that evening. Perhaps he might deliver a\r\n",
      "different opinion, and think that Raffles was getting into a less\r\n",
      "hopeful state. Should he send for Lydgate? If Raffles were really\r\n",
      "getting worse, and slowly dying, Bulstrode felt that he could go to bed\r\n",
      "and sleep in gratitude to Providence. But was he worse? Lydgate might\r\n",
      "come and simply say that he was going on as he expected, and predict\r\n",
      "that he would by-and-by fall into a good sleep, and get well. What was\r\n",
      "the use of sending for him? Bulstrode shrank from that result. No ideas\r\n",
      "or opinions could hinder him from seeing the one probability to be,\r\n",
      "that Raffles recovered would be just the same man as before, with his\r\n",
      "strength as a tormentor renewed, obliging him to drag away his wife to\r\n",
      "spend her years apart from her friends and native place, carrying an\r\n",
      "alienating suspicion against him in her heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had sat an hour and a half in this conflict by the firelight only,\r\n",
      "when a sudden thought made him rise and light the bed-candle, which he\r\n",
      "had brought down with him. The thought was, that he had not told Mrs.\r\n",
      "Abel when the doses of opium must cease.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took hold of the candlestick, but stood motionless for a long while.\r\n",
      "She might already have given him more than Lydgate had prescribed. But\r\n",
      "it was excusable in him, that he should forget part of an order, in his\r\n",
      "present wearied condition. He walked up-stairs, candle in hand, not\r\n",
      "knowing whether he should straightway enter his own room and go to bed,\r\n",
      "or turn to the patient’s room and rectify his omission. He paused in\r\n",
      "the passage, with his face turned towards Raffles’s room, and he could\r\n",
      "hear him moaning and murmuring. He was not asleep, then. Who could know\r\n",
      "that Lydgate’s prescription would not be better disobeyed than\r\n",
      "followed, since there was still no sleep?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned into his own room. Before he had quite undressed, Mrs. Abel\r\n",
      "rapped at the door; he opened it an inch, so that he could hear her\r\n",
      "speak low.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the\r\n",
      "poor creetur? He feels sinking away, and nothing else will he\r\n",
      "swaller—and but little strength in it, if he did—only the opium. And he\r\n",
      "says more and more he’s sinking down through the earth.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To her surprise, Mr. Bulstrode did not answer. A struggle was going on\r\n",
      "within him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think he must die for want o’ support, if he goes on in that way.\r\n",
      "When I nursed my poor master, Mr. Robisson, I had to give him port-wine\r\n",
      "and brandy constant, and a big glass at a time,” added Mrs. Abel, with\r\n",
      "a touch of remonstrance in her tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "you wish it, sir, I’m sure. Else I should give him our own bottle o’\r\n",
      "rum as we keep by us. But a sitter-up so as you’ve been, and doing\r\n",
      "everything as laid in your power—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here a key was thrust through the inch of doorway, and Mr. Bulstrode\r\n",
      "said huskily, “That is the key of the wine-cooler. You will find plenty\r\n",
      "of brandy there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Early in the morning—about six—Mr. Bulstrode rose and spent some time\r\n",
      "in prayer. Does any one suppose that private prayer is necessarily\r\n",
      "candid—necessarily goes to the roots of action? Private prayer is\r\n",
      "inaudible speech, and speech is representative: who can represent\r\n",
      "himself just as he is, even in his own reflections? Bulstrode had not\r\n",
      "yet unravelled in his thought the confused promptings of the last\r\n",
      "four-and-twenty hours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He listened in the passage, and could hear hard stertorous breathing.\r\n",
      "Then he walked out in the garden, and looked at the early rime on the\r\n",
      "grass and fresh spring leaves. When he re-entered the house, he felt\r\n",
      "startled at the sight of Mrs. Abel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How is your patient—asleep, I think?” he said, with an attempt at\r\n",
      "cheerfulness in his tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s gone very deep, sir,” said Mrs. Abel. “He went off gradual\r\n",
      "between three and four o’clock. Would you please to go and look at him?\r\n",
      "I thought it no harm to leave him. My man’s gone afield, and the little\r\n",
      "girl’s seeing to the kettles.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode went up. At a glance he knew that Raffles was not in the\r\n",
      "sleep which brings revival, but in the sleep which streams deeper and\r\n",
      "deeper into the gulf of death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked round the room and saw a bottle with some brandy in it, and\r\n",
      "the almost empty opium phial. He put the phial out of sight, and\r\n",
      "carried the brandy-bottle down-stairs with him, locking it again in the\r\n",
      "wine-cooler.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While breakfasting he considered whether he should ride to Middlemarch\r\n",
      "at once, or wait for Lydgate’s arrival. He decided to wait, and told\r\n",
      "Mrs. Abel that she might go about her work—he could watch in the\r\n",
      "bed-chamber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he sat there and beheld the enemy of his peace going irrevocably\r\n",
      "into silence, he felt more at rest than he had done for many months.\r\n",
      "His conscience was soothed by the enfolding wing of secrecy, which\r\n",
      "seemed just then like an angel sent down for his relief. He drew out\r\n",
      "his pocket-book to review various memoranda there as to the\r\n",
      "arrangements he had projected and partly carried out in the prospect of\r\n",
      "quitting Middlemarch, and considered how far he would let them stand or\r\n",
      "recall them, now that his absence would be brief. Some economies which\r\n",
      "he felt desirable might still find a suitable occasion in his temporary\r\n",
      "withdrawal from management, and he hoped still that Mrs. Casaubon would\r\n",
      "take a large share in the expenses of the Hospital. In that way the\r\n",
      "moments passed, until a change in the stertorous breathing was marked\r\n",
      "enough to draw his attention wholly to the bed, and forced him to think\r\n",
      "of the departing life, which had once been subservient to his own—which\r\n",
      "he had once been glad to find base enough for him to act on as he\r\n",
      "would. It was his gladness then which impelled him now to be glad that\r\n",
      "the life was at an end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And who could say that the death of Raffles had been hastened? Who knew\r\n",
      "what would have saved him?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate arrived at half-past ten, in time to witness the final pause of\r\n",
      "the breath. When he entered the room Bulstrode observed a sudden\r\n",
      "expression in his face, which was not so much surprise as a recognition\r\n",
      "that he had not judged correctly. He stood by the bed in silence for\r\n",
      "some time, with his eyes turned on the dying man, but with that subdued\r\n",
      "activity of expression which showed that he was carrying on an inward\r\n",
      "debate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When did this change begin?” said he, looking at Bulstrode.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not watch by him last night,” said Bulstrode. “I was over-worn,\r\n",
      "and left him under Mrs. Abel’s care. She said that he sank into sleep\r\n",
      "between three and four o’clock. When I came in before eight he was\r\n",
      "nearly in this condition.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate did not ask another question, but watched in silence until he\r\n",
      "said, “It’s all over.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This morning Lydgate was in a state of recovered hope and freedom. He\r\n",
      "had set out on his work with all his old animation, and felt himself\r\n",
      "strong enough to bear all the deficiencies of his married life. And he\r\n",
      "was conscious that Bulstrode had been a benefactor to him. But he was\r\n",
      "uneasy about this case. He had not expected it to terminate as it had\r\n",
      "done. Yet he hardly knew how to put a question on the subject to\r\n",
      "Bulstrode without appearing to insult him; and if he examined the\r\n",
      "housekeeper—why, the man was dead. There seemed to be no use in\r\n",
      "implying that somebody’s ignorance or imprudence had killed him. And\r\n",
      "after all, he himself might be wrong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He and Bulstrode rode back to Middlemarch together, talking of many\r\n",
      "things—chiefly cholera and the chances of the Reform Bill in the House\r\n",
      "of Lords, and the firm resolve of the political Unions. Nothing was\r\n",
      "said about Raffles, except that Bulstrode mentioned the necessity of\r\n",
      "having a grave for him in Lowick churchyard, and observed that, so far\r\n",
      "as he knew, the poor man had no connections, except Rigg, whom he had\r\n",
      "stated to be unfriendly towards him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On returning home Lydgate had a visit from Mr. Farebrother. The Vicar\r\n",
      "had not been in the town the day before, but the news that there was an\r\n",
      "execution in Lydgate’s house had got to Lowick by the evening, having\r\n",
      "been carried by Mr. Spicer, shoemaker and parish-clerk, who had it from\r\n",
      "his brother, the respectable bell-hanger in Lowick Gate. Since that\r\n",
      "evening when Lydgate had come down from the billiard room with Fred\r\n",
      "Vincy, Mr. Farebrother’s thoughts about him had been rather gloomy.\r\n",
      "Playing at the Green Dragon once or oftener might have been a trifle in\r\n",
      "another man; but in Lydgate it was one of several signs that he was\r\n",
      "getting unlike his former self. He was beginning to do things for which\r\n",
      "he had formerly even an excessive scorn. Whatever certain\r\n",
      "dissatisfactions in marriage, which some silly tinklings of gossip had\r\n",
      "given him hints of, might have to do with this change, Mr. Farebrother\r\n",
      "felt sure that it was chiefly connected with the debts which were being\r\n",
      "more and more distinctly reported, and he began to fear that any notion\r\n",
      "of Lydgate’s having resources or friends in the background must be\r\n",
      "quite illusory. The rebuff he had met with in his first attempt to win\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s confidence, disinclined him to a second; but this news of the\r\n",
      "execution being actually in the house, determined the Vicar to overcome\r\n",
      "his reluctance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate had just dismissed a poor patient, in whom he was much\r\n",
      "interested, and he came forward to put out his hand—with an open\r\n",
      "cheerfulness which surprised Mr. Farebrother. Could this too be a proud\r\n",
      "rejection of sympathy and help? Never mind; the sympathy and help\r\n",
      "should be offered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How are you, Lydgate? I came to see you because I had heard something\r\n",
      "which made me anxious about you,” said the Vicar, in the tone of a good\r\n",
      "brother, only that there was no reproach in it. They were both seated\r\n",
      "by this time, and Lydgate answered immediately—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think I know what you mean. You had heard that there was an\r\n",
      "execution in the house?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; is it true?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was true,” said Lydgate, with an air of freedom, as if he did not\r\n",
      "mind talking about the affair now. “But the danger is over; the debt is\r\n",
      "paid. I am out of my difficulties now: I shall be freed from debts, and\r\n",
      "able, I hope, to start afresh on a better plan.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very thankful to hear it,” said the Vicar, falling back in his\r\n",
      "chair, and speaking with that low-toned quickness which often follows\r\n",
      "the removal of a load. “I like that better than all the news in the\r\n",
      "‘Times.’ I confess I came to you with a heavy heart.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you for coming,” said Lydgate, cordially. “I can enjoy the\r\n",
      "kindness all the more because I am happier. I have certainly been a\r\n",
      "good deal crushed. I’m afraid I shall find the bruises still painful\r\n",
      "by-and by,” he added, smiling rather sadly; “but just now I can only\r\n",
      "feel that the torture-screw is off.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Farebrother was silent for a moment, and then said earnestly, “My\r\n",
      "dear fellow, let me ask you one question. Forgive me if I take a\r\n",
      "liberty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t believe you will ask anything that ought to offend me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then—this is necessary to set my heart quite at rest—you have not—have\r\n",
      "you?—in order to pay your debts, incurred another debt which may harass\r\n",
      "you worse hereafter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Lydgate, coloring slightly. “There is no reason why I should\r\n",
      "not tell you—since the fact is so—that the person to whom I am indebted\r\n",
      "is Bulstrode. He has made me a very handsome advance—a thousand\r\n",
      "pounds—and he can afford to wait for repayment.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that is generous,” said Mr. Farebrother, compelling himself to\r\n",
      "approve of the man whom he disliked. His delicate feeling shrank from\r\n",
      "dwelling even in his thought on the fact that he had always urged\r\n",
      "Lydgate to avoid any personal entanglement with Bulstrode. He added\r\n",
      "immediately, “And Bulstrode must naturally feel an interest in your\r\n",
      "welfare, after you have worked with him in a way which has probably\r\n",
      "reduced your income instead of adding to it. I am glad to think that he\r\n",
      "has acted accordingly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate felt uncomfortable under these kindly suppositions. They made\r\n",
      "more distinct within him the uneasy consciousness which had shown its\r\n",
      "first dim stirrings only a few hours before, that Bulstrode’s motives\r\n",
      "for his sudden beneficence following close upon the chillest\r\n",
      "indifference might be merely selfish. He let the kindly suppositions\r\n",
      "pass. He could not tell the history of the loan, but it was more\r\n",
      "vividly present with him than ever, as well as the fact which the Vicar\r\n",
      "delicately ignored—that this relation of personal indebtedness to\r\n",
      "Bulstrode was what he had once been most resolved to avoid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began, instead of answering, to speak of his projected economies,\r\n",
      "and of his having come to look at his life from a different point of\r\n",
      "view.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall set up a surgery,” he said. “I really think I made a mistaken\r\n",
      "effort in that respect. And if Rosamond will not mind, I shall take an\r\n",
      "apprentice. I don’t like these things, but if one carries them out\r\n",
      "faithfully they are not really lowering. I have had a severe galling to\r\n",
      "begin with: that will make the small rubs seem easy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Lydgate! the “if Rosamond will not mind,” which had fallen from\r\n",
      "him involuntarily as part of his thought, was a significant mark of the\r\n",
      "yoke he bore. But Mr. Farebrother, whose hopes entered strongly into\r\n",
      "the same current with Lydgate’s, and who knew nothing about him that\r\n",

      "Five days after the death of Raffles, Mr. Bambridge was standing at his\r\n",
      "leisure under the large archway leading into the yard of the Green\r\n",
      "Dragon. He was not fond of solitary contemplation, but he had only just\r\n",
      "come out of the house, and any human figure standing at ease under the\r\n",
      "archway in the early afternoon was as certain to attract companionship\r\n",
      "as a pigeon which has found something worth pecking at. In this case\r\n",
      "there was no material object to feed upon, but the eye of reason saw a\r\n",
      "probability of mental sustenance in the shape of gossip. Mr. Hopkins,\r\n",
      "the meek-mannered draper opposite, was the first to act on this inward\r\n",
      "vision, being the more ambitious of a little masculine talk because his\r\n",
      "customers were chiefly women. Mr. Bambridge was rather curt to the\r\n",
      "draper, feeling that Hopkins was of course glad to talk to _him_, but\r\n",
      "that he was not going to waste much of his talk on Hopkins. Soon,\r\n",
      "however, there was a small cluster of more important listeners, who\r\n",
      "were either deposited from the passers-by, or had sauntered to the spot\r\n",
      "expressly to see if there were anything going on at the Green Dragon;\r\n",

      "made on a journey in the north from which he had just returned.\r\n",
      "Gentlemen present were assured that when they could show him anything\r\n",
      "to cut out a blood mare, a bay, rising four, which was to be seen at\r\n",

      "gratify them by being shot “from here to Hereford.” Also, a pair of\r\n",
      "blacks which he was going to put into the break recalled vividly to his\r\n",

      "When the discourse was at this point of animation, came up Mr. Frank\r\n",
      "Hawley. He was not a man to compromise his dignity by lounging at the\r\n",
      "Green Dragon, but happening to pass along the High Street and seeing\r\n",
      "Bambridge on the other side, he took some of his long strides across to\r\n",
      "ask the horsedealer whether he had found the first-rate gig-horse which\r\n",
      "he had engaged to look for. Mr. Hawley was requested to wait until he\r\n",
      "had seen a gray selected at Bilkley: if that did not meet his wishes to\r\n",
      "a hair, Bambridge did not know a horse when he saw it, which seemed to\r\n",
      "be the highest conceivable unlikelihood. Mr. Hawley, standing with his\r\n",
      "back to the street, was fixing a time for looking at the gray and\r\n",
      "seeing it tried, when a horseman passed slowly by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bulstrode!” said two or three voices at once in a low tone, one of\r\n",
      "them, which was the draper’s, respectfully prefixing the “Mr.;” but\r\n",
      "nobody having more intention in this interjectural naming than if they\r\n",
      "had said “the Riverston coach” when that vehicle appeared in the\r\n",
      "distance. Mr. Hawley gave a careless glance round at Bulstrode’s back,\r\n",
      "but as Bambridge’s eyes followed it he made a sarcastic grimace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By jingo! that reminds me,” he began, lowering his voice a little, “I\r\n",
      "picked up something else at Bilkley besides your gig-horse, Mr. Hawley.\r\n",
      "I picked up a fine story about Bulstrode. Do you know how he came by\r\n",
      "his fortune? Any gentleman wanting a bit of curious information, I can\r\n",
      "give it him free of expense. If everybody got their deserts, Bulstrode\r\n",
      "might have had to say his prayers at Botany Bay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you mean?” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his hands into his\r\n",
      "pockets, and pushing a little forward under the archway. If Bulstrode\r\n",
      "should turn out to be a rascal, Frank Hawley had a prophetic soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I had it from a party who was an old chum of Bulstrode’s. I’ll tell\r\n",
      "you where I first picked him up,” said Bambridge, with a sudden gesture\r\n",
      "of his fore-finger. “He was at Larcher’s sale, but I knew nothing of\r\n",
      "him then—he slipped through my fingers—was after Bulstrode, no doubt.\r\n",
      "He tells me he can tap Bulstrode to any amount, knows all his secrets.\r\n",
      "However, he blabbed to me at Bilkley: he takes a stiff glass. Damme if\r\n",
      "I think he meant to turn king’s evidence; but he’s that sort of\r\n",
      "bragging fellow, the bragging runs over hedge and ditch with him, till\r\n",
      "he’d brag of a spavin as if it ’ud fetch money. A man should know when\r\n",
      "to pull up.” Mr. Bambridge made this remark with an air of disgust,\r\n",
      "satisfied that his own bragging showed a fine sense of the marketable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the man’s name? Where can he be found?” said Mr. Hawley.\r\n",

      "He was buried at Lowick. Mr. Bulstrode followed him. A very decent\r\n",
      "funeral.” There was a strong sensation among the listeners. Mr.\r\n",
      "Bambridge gave an ejaculation in which “brimstone” was the mildest\r\n",
      "word, and Mr. Hawley, knitting his brows and bending his head forward,\r\n",
      "exclaimed, “What?—where did the man die?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At Stone Court,” said the draper. “The housekeeper said he was a\r\n",
      "relation of the master’s. He came there ill on Friday.”\r\n",

      "third morning.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The group had already become larger, the town-clerk’s presence being a\r\n",
      "guarantee that something worth listening to was going on there; and Mr.\r\n",
      "Bambridge delivered his narrative in the hearing of seven. It was\r\n",
      "mainly what we know, including the fact about Will Ladislaw, with some\r\n",
      "local color and circumstance added: it was what Bulstrode had dreaded\r\n",
      "the betrayal of—and hoped to have buried forever with the corpse of\r\n",
      "Raffles—it was that haunting ghost of his earlier life which as he rode\r\n",
      "past the archway of the Green Dragon he was trusting that Providence\r\n",
      "had delivered him from. Yes, Providence. He had not confessed to\r\n",
      "himself yet that he had done anything in the way of contrivance to this\r\n",
      "end; he had accepted what seemed to have been offered. It was\r\n",
      "impossible to prove that he had done anything which hastened the\r\n",

      "smell of fire. Mr. Frank Hawley followed up his information by sending\r\n",
      "a clerk whom he could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of inquiring\r\n",
      "about hay, but really to gather all that could be learned about Raffles\r\n",
      "and his illness from Mrs. Abel. In this way it came to his knowledge\r\n",
      "that Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his gig; and Mr.\r\n",
      "Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling at\r\n",
      "his office to ask whether he had time to undertake an arbitration if it\r\n",
      "were required, and then asking him incidentally about Raffles. Caleb\r\n",
      "was betrayed into no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact which\r\n",
      "he was forced to admit, that he had given up acting for him within the\r\n",
      "last week. Mr Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling convinced that\r\n",
      "Raffles had told his story to Garth, and that Garth had given up\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s affairs in consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr.\r\n",
      "Toller. The statement was passed on until it had quite lost the stamp\r\n",
      "of an inference, and was taken as information coming straight from\r\n",
      "Garth, so that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to\r\n",
      "be the chief publisher of Bulstrode’s misdemeanors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Hawley was not slow to perceive that there was no handle for the\r\n",
      "law either in the revelations made by Raffles or in the circumstances\r\n",
      "of his death. He had himself ridden to Lowick village that he might\r\n",
      "look at the register and talk over the whole matter with Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother, who was not more surprised than the lawyer that an ugly\r\n",
      "secret should have come to light about Bulstrode, though he had always\r\n",
      "had justice enough in him to hinder his antipathy from turning into\r\n",
      "conclusions. But while they were talking another combination was\r\n",
      "silently going forward in Mr. Farebrother’s mind, which foreshadowed\r\n",
      "what was soon to be loudly spoken of in Middlemarch as a necessary\r\n",
      "“putting of two and two together.” With the reasons which kept\r\n",
      "Bulstrode in dread of Raffles there flashed the thought that the dread\r\n",
      "might have something to do with his munificence towards his medical\r\n",
      "man; and though he resisted the suggestion that it had been consciously\r\n",
      "accepted in any way as a bribe, he had a foreboding that this\r\n",
      "complication of things might be of malignant effect on Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "reputation. He perceived that Mr. Hawley knew nothing at present of the\r\n",
      "sudden relief from debt, and he himself was careful to glide away from\r\n",
      "all approaches towards the subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” he said, with a deep breath, wanting to wind up the illimitable\r\n",
      "discussion of what might have been, though nothing could be legally\r\n",
      "proven, “it is a strange story. So our mercurial Ladislaw has a queer\r\n",
      "genealogy! A high-spirited young lady and a musical Polish patriot made\r\n",
      "a likely enough stock for him to spring from, but I should never have\r\n",
      "suspected a grafting of the Jew pawnbroker. However, there’s no knowing\r\n",
      "what a mixture will turn out beforehand. Some sorts of dirt serve to\r\n",
      "clarify.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s just what I should have expected,” said Mr. Hawley, mounting his\r\n",
      "horse. “Any cursed alien blood, Jew, Corsican, or Gypsy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know he’s one of your black sheep, Hawley. But he is really a\r\n",
      "disinterested, unworldly fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, ay, that is your Whiggish twist,” said Mr. Hawley, who had been in\r\n",

      "pleasant good-hearted fellow you would mistake him for a Tory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Raffles in any other light than as a piece of evidence on the side of\r\n",
      "Bulstrode. But the news that Lydgate had all at once become able not\r\n",
      "only to get rid of the execution in his house but to pay all his debts\r\n",
      "in Middlemarch was spreading fast, gathering round it conjectures and\r\n",
      "comments which gave it new body and impetus, and soon filling the ears\r\n",
      "of other persons besides Mr. Hawley, who were not slow to see a\r\n",
      "significant relation between this sudden command of money and\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s desire to stifle the scandal of Raffles. That the money\r\n",
      "came from Bulstrode would infallibly have been guessed even if there\r\n",
      "had been no direct evidence of it; for it had beforehand entered into\r\n",
      "the gossip about Lydgate’s affairs, that neither his father-in-law nor\r\n",
      "his own family would do anything for him, and direct evidence was\r\n",
      "furnished not only by a clerk at the Bank, but by innocent Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode herself, who mentioned the loan to Mrs. Plymdale, who\r\n",
      "mentioned it to her daughter-in-law of the house of Toller, who\r\n",
      "mentioned it generally. The business was felt to be so public and\r\n",
      "important that it required dinners to feed it, and many invitations\r\n",
      "were just then issued and accepted on the strength of this scandal\r\n",
      "concerning Bulstrode and Lydgate; wives, widows, and single ladies took\r\n",
      "their work and went out to tea oftener than usual; and all public\r\n",
      "conviviality, from the Green Dragon to Dollop’s, gathered a zest which\r\n",
      "could not be won from the question whether the Lords would throw out\r\n",
      "the Reform Bill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For hardly anybody doubted that some scandalous reason or other was at\r\n",
      "the bottom of Bulstrode’s liberality to Lydgate. Mr. Hawley indeed, in\r\n",
      "the first instance, invited a select party, including the two\r\n",
      "physicians, with Mr Toller and Mr. Wrench, expressly to hold a close\r\n",
      "discussion as to the probabilities of Raffles’s illness, reciting to\r\n",
      "them all the particulars which had been gathered from Mrs. Abel in\r\n",
      "connection with Lydgate’s certificate, that the death was due to\r\n",
      "delirium tremens; and the medical gentlemen, who all stood\r\n",
      "undisturbedly on the old paths in relation to this disease, declared\r\n",
      "that they could see nothing in these particulars which could be\r\n",
      "transformed into a positive ground of suspicion. But the moral grounds\r\n",
      "of suspicion remained: the strong motives Bulstrode clearly had for\r\n",
      "wishing to be rid of Raffles, and the fact that at this critical moment\r\n",
      "he had given Lydgate the help which he must for some time have known\r\n",
      "the need for; the disposition, moreover, to believe that Bulstrode\r\n",
      "would be unscrupulous, and the absence of any indisposition to believe\r\n",
      "that Lydgate might be as easily bribed as other haughty-minded men when\r\n",
      "they have found themselves in want of money. Even if the money had been\r\n",
      "given merely to make him hold his tongue about the scandal of\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s earlier life, the fact threw an odious light on Lydgate,\r\n",
      "who had long been sneered at as making himself subservient to the\r\n",
      "banker for the sake of working himself into predominance, and\r\n",
      "discrediting the elder members of his profession. Hence, in spite of\r\n",
      "the negative as to any direct sign of guilt in relation to the death at\r\n",
      "Stone Court, Mr. Hawley’s select party broke up with the sense that the\r\n",
      "affair had “an ugly look.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this vague conviction of indeterminable guilt, which was enough to\r\n",
      "keep up much head-shaking and biting innuendo even among substantial\r\n",
      "professional seniors, had for the general mind all the superior power\r\n",
      "of mystery over fact. Everybody liked better to conjecture how the\r\n",
      "thing was, than simply to know it; for conjecture soon became more\r\n",
      "confident than knowledge, and had a more liberal allowance for the\r\n",
      "incompatible. Even the more definite scandal concerning Bulstrode’s\r\n",
      "earlier life was, for some minds, melted into the mass of mystery, as\r\n",
      "so much lively metal to be poured out in dialogue, and to take such\r\n",
      "fantastic shapes as heaven pleased.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the tone of thought chiefly sanctioned by Mrs. Dollop, the\r\n",
      "spirited landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane, who had often to\r\n",
      "resist the shallow pragmatism of customers disposed to think that their\r\n",
      "reports from the outer world were of equal force with what had “come\r\n",
      "up” in her mind. How it had been brought to her she didn’t know, but it\r\n",
      "was there before her as if it had been “scored with the chalk on the\r\n",
      "chimney-board—” as Bulstrode should say, “his inside was _that black_\r\n",
      "as if the hairs of his head knowed the thoughts of his heart, he’d tear\r\n",
      "’em up by the roots.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s odd,” said Mr. Limp, a meditative shoemaker, with weak eyes and\r\n",
      "a piping voice. “Why, I read in the ‘Trumpet’ that was what the Duke of\r\n",
      "Wellington said when he turned his coat and went over to the Romans.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very like,” said Mrs. Dollop. “If one raskill said it, it’s more\r\n",
      "reason why another should. But hypo_crite_ as he’s been, and holding\r\n",
      "things with that high hand, as there was no parson i’ the country good\r\n",

      "get rid of Bulstrode. Mr. Thesiger is turned against him, and wants him\r\n",
      "out o’ the parish. And there’s gentlemen in this town says they’d as\r\n",

      "out of it,” said Mr. Limp, quaveringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, there’s better folks spend their money worse,” said a firm-voiced\r\n",
      "dyer, whose crimson hands looked out of keeping with his good-natured\r\n",
      "face.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No such thing!” said the barber, who felt himself a little above his\r\n",
      "company at Dollop’s, but liked it none the worse. “Fletcher says it’s\r\n",
      "no such thing. He says they might prove over and over again whose child\r\n",
      "this young Ladislaw was, and they’d do no more than if they proved I\r\n",

      "know? It’s a poor tale, with all the law as there is up and down, if\r\n",
      "it’s no use proving whose child you are. Fletcher may say that if he\r\n",
      "likes, but I say, don’t Fletcher _me_!”\r\n",

      "he could not miss the signs of cordiality; moreover, he had been taking\r\n",
      "journeys on business of various kinds, having now made up his mind that\r\n",
      "he need not quit Middlemarch, and feeling able consequently to\r\n",

      "which would give emphasis to his undefined suspicions. As to any\r\n",
      "certainty that a particular method of treatment would either save or\r\n",
      "kill, Lydgate himself was constantly arguing against such dogmatism; he\r\n",
      "had no right to speak, and he had every motive for being silent. Hence\r\n",

      "Board for the superintendence of such measures appointed in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch, and much cleansing and preparation had been concurred in\r\n",
      "by Whigs and Tories. The question now was, whether a piece of ground\r\n",
      "outside the town should be secured as a burial-ground by means of\r\n",
      "assessment or by private subscription. The meeting was to be open, and\r\n",

      "they made their way thither. Mr. Farebrother sat opposite, not far from\r\n",
      "Mr. Hawley; all the medical men were there; Mr. Thesiger was in the\r\n",

      "Lydgate noticed a peculiar interchange of glances when he and Bulstrode\r\n",
      "took their seats.\r\n",

      "After the business had been fully opened by the chairman, who pointed\r\n",
      "out the advantages of purchasing by subscription a piece of ground\r\n",
      "large enough to be ultimately used as a general cemetery, Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, whose rather high-pitched but subdued and fluent voice the\r\n",
      "town was used to at meetings of this sort, rose and asked leave to\r\n",
      "deliver his opinion. Lydgate could see again the peculiar interchange\r\n",
      "of glances before Mr. Hawley started up, and said in his firm resonant\r\n",
      "voice, “Mr. Chairman, I request that before any one delivers his\r\n",
      "opinion on this point I may be permitted to speak on a question of\r\n",
      "public feeling, which not only by myself, but by many gentlemen\r\n",
      "present, is regarded as preliminary.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Hawley’s mode of speech, even when public decorum repressed his\r\n",
      "“awful language,” was formidable in its curtness and self-possession.\r\n",
      "Mr. Thesiger sanctioned the request, Mr. Bulstrode sat down, and Mr.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“In what I have to say, Mr. Chairman, I am not speaking simply on my\r\n",
      "own behalf: I am speaking with the concurrence and at the express\r\n",
      "request of no fewer than eight of my fellow-townsmen, who are\r\n",
      "immediately around us. It is our united sentiment that Mr. Bulstrode\r\n",
      "should be called upon—and I do now call upon him—to resign public\r\n",
      "positions which he holds not simply as a tax-payer, but as a gentleman\r\n",
      "among gentlemen. There are practices and there are acts which, owing to\r\n",
      "circumstances, the law cannot visit, though they may be worse than many\r\n",
      "things which are legally punishable. Honest men and gentlemen, if they\r\n",
      "don’t want the company of people who perpetrate such acts, have got to\r\n",
      "defend themselves as they best can, and that is what I and the friends\r\n",
      "whom I may call my clients in this affair are determined to do. I don’t\r\n",

      "upon him either publicly to deny and confute the scandalous statements\r\n",
      "made against him by a man now dead, and who died in his house—the\r\n",
      "statement that he was for many years engaged in nefarious practices,\r\n",
      "and that he won his fortune by dishonest procedures—or else to withdraw\r\n",
      "from positions which could only have been allowed him as a gentleman\r\n",
      "among gentlemen.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All eyes in the room were turned on Mr. Bulstrode, who, since the first\r\n",
      "mention of his name, had been going through a crisis of feeling almost\r\n",
      "too violent for his delicate frame to support. Lydgate, who himself was\r\n",
      "undergoing a shock as from the terrible practical interpretation of\r\n",
      "some faint augury, felt, nevertheless, that his own movement of\r\n",
      "resentful hatred was checked by that instinct of the Healer which\r\n",
      "thinks first of bringing rescue or relief to the sufferer, when he\r\n",
      "looked at the shrunken misery of Bulstrode’s livid face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The quick vision that his life was after all a failure, that he was a\r\n",
      "dishonored man, and must quail before the glance of those towards whom\r\n",
      "he had habitually assumed the attitude of a reprover—that God had\r\n",
      "disowned him before men and left him unscreened to the triumphant scorn\r\n",
      "of those who were glad to have their hatred justified—the sense of\r\n",
      "utter futility in that equivocation with his conscience in dealing with\r\n",
      "the life of his accomplice, an equivocation which now turned venomously\r\n",
      "upon him with the full-grown fang of a discovered lie:—all this rushed\r\n",
      "through him like the agony of terror which fails to kill, and leaves\r\n",
      "the ears still open to the returning wave of execration. The sudden\r\n",
      "sense of exposure after the re-established sense of safety came—not to\r\n",
      "the coarse organization of a criminal, but to the susceptible nerve of\r\n",
      "a man whose intensest being lay in such mastery and predominance as the\r\n",
      "conditions of his life had shaped for him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in that intense being lay the strength of reaction. Through all his\r\n",
      "bodily infirmity there ran a tenacious nerve of ambitious\r\n",
      "self-preserving will, which had continually leaped out like a flame,\r\n",
      "scattering all doctrinal fears, and which, even while he sat an object\r\n",
      "of compassion for the merciful, was beginning to stir and glow under\r\n",
      "his ashy paleness. Before the last words were out of Mr. Hawley’s\r\n",
      "mouth, Bulstrode felt that he should answer, and that his answer would\r\n",
      "be a retort. He dared not get up and say, “I am not guilty, the whole\r\n",
      "story is false”—even if he had dared this, it would have seemed to him,\r\n",
      "under his present keen sense of betrayal, as vain as to pull, for\r\n",
      "covering to his nakedness, a frail rag which would rend at every little\r\n",
      "strain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a few moments there was total silence, while every man in the room\r\n",
      "was looking at Bulstrode. He sat perfectly still, leaning hard against\r\n",
      "the back of his chair; he could not venture to rise, and when he began\r\n",
      "to speak he pressed his hands upon the seat on each side of him. But\r\n",
      "his voice was perfectly audible, though hoarser than usual, and his\r\n",
      "words were distinctly pronounced, though he paused between sentence as\r\n",
      "if short of breath. He said, turning first toward Mr. Thesiger, and\r\n",
      "then looking at Mr. Hawley—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I protest before you, sir, as a Christian minister, against the\r\n",
      "sanction of proceedings towards me which are dictated by virulent\r\n",
      "hatred. Those who are hostile to me are glad to believe any libel\r\n",
      "uttered by a loose tongue against me. And their consciences become\r\n",
      "strict against me. Say that the evil-speaking of which I am to be made\r\n",
      "the victim accuses me of malpractices—” here Bulstrode’s voice rose and\r\n",
      "took on a more biting accent, till it seemed a low cry—“who shall be my\r\n",
      "accuser? Not men whose own lives are unchristian, nay, scandalous—not\r\n",
      "men who themselves use low instruments to carry out their ends—whose\r\n",
      "profession is a tissue of chicanery—who have been spending their income\r\n",
      "on their own sensual enjoyments, while I have been devoting mine to\r\n",
      "advance the best objects with regard to this life and the next.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the word chicanery there was a growing noise, half of murmurs and\r\n",
      "half of hisses, while four persons started up at once—Mr. Hawley, Mr.\r\n",
      "Toller, Mr. Chichely, and Mr. Hackbutt; but Mr. Hawley’s outburst was\r\n",
      "instantaneous, and left the others behind in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you mean me, sir, I call you and every one else to the inspection\r\n",
      "of my professional life. As to Christian or unchristian, I repudiate\r\n",
      "your canting palavering Christianity; and as to the way in which I\r\n",
      "spend my income, it is not my principle to maintain thieves and cheat\r\n",
      "offspring of their due inheritance in order to support religion and set\r\n",
      "myself up as a saintly Killjoy. I affect no niceness of conscience—I\r\n",
      "have not found any nice standards necessary yet to measure your actions\r\n",
      "by, sir. And I again call upon you to enter into satisfactory\r\n",
      "explanations concerning the scandals against you, or else to withdraw\r\n",
      "from posts in which we at any rate decline you as a colleague. I say,\r\n",
      "sir, we decline to co-operate with a man whose character is not cleared\r\n",
      "from infamous lights cast upon it, not only by reports but by recent\r\n",
      "actions.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Allow me, Mr. Hawley,” said the chairman; and Mr. Hawley, still\r\n",
      "fuming, bowed half impatiently, and sat down with his hands thrust deep\r\n",
      "in his pockets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Bulstrode, it is not desirable, I think, to prolong the present\r\n",
      "discussion,” said Mr. Thesiger, turning to the pallid trembling man; “I\r\n",
      "must so far concur with what has fallen from Mr. Hawley in expression\r\n",
      "of a general feeling, as to think it due to your Christian profession\r\n",
      "that you should clear yourself, if possible, from unhappy aspersions. I\r\n",
      "for my part should be willing to give you full opportunity and hearing.\r\n",
      "But I must say that your present attitude is painfully inconsistent\r\n",
      "with those principles which you have sought to identify yourself with,\r\n",
      "and for the honor of which I am bound to care. I recommend you at\r\n",
      "present, as your clergyman, and one who hopes for your reinstatement in\r\n",
      "respect, to quit the room, and avoid further hindrance to business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, after a moment’s hesitation, took his hat from the floor and\r\n",
      "slowly rose, but he grasped the corner of the chair so totteringly that\r\n",
      "Lydgate felt sure there was not strength enough in him to walk away\r\n",
      "without support. What could he do? He could not see a man sink close to\r\n",
      "him for want of help. He rose and gave his arm to Bulstrode, and in\r\n",
      "that way led him out of the room; yet this act, which might have been\r\n",
      "one of gentle duty and pure compassion, was at this moment unspeakably\r\n",
      "bitter to him. It seemed as if he were putting his sign-manual to that\r\n",
      "association of himself with Bulstrode, of which he now saw the full\r\n",
      "meaning as it must have presented itself to other minds. He now felt\r\n",
      "the conviction that this man who was leaning tremblingly on his arm,\r\n",
      "had given him the thousand pounds as a bribe, and that somehow the\r\n",
      "treatment of Raffles had been tampered with from an evil motive. The\r\n",
      "inferences were closely linked enough; the town knew of the loan,\r\n",
      "believed it to be a bribe, and believed that he took it as a bribe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Lydgate, his mind struggling under the terrible clutch of this\r\n",
      "revelation, was all the while morally forced to take Mr. Bulstrode to\r\n",
      "the Bank, send a man off for his carriage, and wait to accompany him\r\n",
      "home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile the business of the meeting was despatched, and fringed off\r\n",
      "into eager discussion among various groups concerning this affair of\r\n",
      "Bulstrode—and Lydgate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke, who had before heard only imperfect hints of it, and was\r\n",
      "very uneasy that he had “gone a little too far” in countenancing\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, now got himself fully informed, and felt some benevolent\r\n",
      "sadness in talking to Mr. Farebrother about the ugly light in which\r\n",
      "Lydgate had come to be regarded. Mr. Farebrother was going to walk back\r\n",
      "to Lowick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Step into my carriage,” said Mr. Brooke. “I am going round to see Mrs.\r\n",

      "to see me, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they drove along, Mr. Brooke chatting with good-natured hope that\r\n",
      "there had not really been anything black in Lydgate’s behavior—a young\r\n",
      "fellow whom he had seen to be quite above the common mark, when he\r\n",
      "brought a letter from his uncle Sir Godwin. Mr. Farebrother said\r\n",
      "little: he was deeply mournful: with a keen perception of human\r\n",
      "weakness, he could not be confident that under the pressure of\r\n",
      "humiliating needs Lydgate had not fallen below himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the carriage drove up to the gate of the Manor, Dorothea was out\r\n",
      "on the gravel, and came to greet them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, “we have just come from a meeting—a\r\n",
      "sanitary meeting, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was Mr. Lydgate there?” said Dorothea, who looked full of health and\r\n",
      "animation, and stood with her head bare under the gleaming April\r\n",
      "lights. “I want to see him and have a great consultation with him about\r\n",
      "the Hospital. I have engaged with Mr. Bulstrode to do so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, “we have been hearing bad news—bad\r\n",
      "news, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They walked through the garden towards the churchyard gate, Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother wanting to go on to the parsonage; and Dorothea heard the\r\n",
      "whole sad story.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She listened with deep interest, and begged to hear twice over the\r\n",
      "facts and impressions concerning Lydgate. After a short silence,\r\n",
      "pausing at the churchyard gate, and addressing Mr. Farebrother, she\r\n",
      "said energetically—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t believe that Mr. Lydgate is guilty of anything base? I will\r\n",

      "when she was at the head of her uncle’s table nearly three years\r\n",
      "before, and her experience since had given her more right to express a\r\n",
      "decided opinion. But Sir James Chettam was no longer the diffident and\r\n",
      "acquiescent suitor: he was the anxious brother-in-law, with a devout\r\n",
      "admiration for his sister, but with a constant alarm lest she should\r\n",
      "fall under some new illusion almost as bad as marrying Casaubon. He\r\n",
      "smiled much less; when he said “Exactly” it was more often an\r\n",
      "introduction to a dissentient opinion than in those submissive bachelor\r\n",
      "days; and Dorothea found to her surprise that she had to resolve not to\r\n",

      "“Whatever you do in the end, Dorothea, you should really keep back at\r\n",
      "present, and not volunteer any meddling with this Bulstrode business.\r\n",

      "disobedience to his orders, however it might have arisen, could not be\r\n",
      "considered a crime, that in the dominant opinion obedience to his\r\n",
      "orders was just as likely to be fatal, and that the affair was simply\r\n",

      "ever a woman was crushed, she will be. I pity her from my heart. And\r\n",
      "with all her faults, few women are better. From a girl she had the\r\n",
      "neatest ways, and was always good-hearted, and as open as the day. You\r\n",
      "might look into her drawers when you would—always the same. And so she\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That would suit _her_ well enough, I dare say,” said Mrs. Plymdale;\r\n",
      "“there is that kind of lightness about her. But she got that from her\r\n",
      "mother; she never got it from her aunt Bulstrode, who always gave her\r\n",
      "good advice, and to my knowledge would rather have had her marry\r\n",
      "elsewhere.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Plymdale was in a situation which caused her some complication of\r\n",
      "feeling. There had been not only her intimacy with Mrs. Bulstrode, but\r\n",
      "also a profitable business relation of the great Plymdale dyeing house\r\n",
      "with Mr. Bulstrode, which on the one hand would have inclined her to\r\n",
      "desire that the mildest view of his character should be the true one,\r\n",
      "but on the other, made her the more afraid of seeming to palliate his\r\n",
      "culpability. Again, the late alliance of her family with the Tollers\r\n",
      "had brought her in connection with the best circle, which gratified her\r\n",
      "in every direction except in the inclination to those serious views\r\n",
      "which she believed to be the best in another sense. The sharp little\r\n",
      "woman’s conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these\r\n",
      "opposing “bests,” and of her griefs and satisfactions under late\r\n",
      "events, which were likely to humble those who needed humbling, but also\r\n",
      "to fall heavily on her old friend whose faults she would have preferred\r\n",
      "seeing on a background of prosperity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Mrs. Bulstrode, meanwhile, had been no further shaken by the\r\n",
      "oncoming tread of calamity than in the busier stirring of that secret\r\n",
      "uneasiness which had always been present in her since the last visit of\r\n",
      "Raffles to The Shrubs. That the hateful man had come ill to Stone\r\n",
      "Court, and that her husband had chosen to remain there and watch over\r\n",
      "him, she allowed to be explained by the fact that Raffles had been\r\n",
      "employed and aided in earlier-days, and that this made a tie of\r\n",
      "benevolence towards him in his degraded helplessness; and she had been\r\n",
      "since then innocently cheered by her husband’s more hopeful speech\r\n",
      "about his own health and ability to continue his attention to business.\r\n",
      "The calm was disturbed when Lydgate had brought him home ill from the\r\n",
      "meeting, and in spite of comforting assurances during the next few\r\n",
      "days, she cried in private from the conviction that her husband was not\r\n",
      "suffering from bodily illness merely, but from something that afflicted\r\n",
      "his mind. He would not allow her to read to him, and scarcely to sit\r\n",
      "with him, alleging nervous susceptibility to sounds and movements; yet\r\n",
      "she suspected that in shutting himself up in his private room he wanted\r\n",
      "to be busy with his papers. Something, she felt sure, had happened.\r\n",
      "Perhaps it was some great loss of money; and she was kept in the dark.\r\n",
      "Not daring to question her husband, she said to Lydgate, on the fifth\r\n",
      "day after the meeting, when she had not left home except to go to\r\n",
      "church—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Lydgate, pray be open with me: I like to know the truth. Has\r\n",
      "anything happened to Mr. Bulstrode?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some little nervous shock,” said Lydgate, evasively. He felt that it\r\n",
      "was not for him to make the painful revelation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what brought it on?” said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking directly at him\r\n",
      "with her large dark eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is often something poisonous in the air of public rooms,” said\r\n",
      "Lydgate. “Strong men can stand it, but it tells on people in proportion\r\n",
      "to the delicacy of their systems. It is often impossible to account for\r\n",
      "the precise moment of an attack—or rather, to say why the strength\r\n",
      "gives way at a particular moment.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bulstrode was not satisfied with this answer. There remained in\r\n",
      "her the belief that some calamity had befallen her husband, of which\r\n",
      "she was to be kept in ignorance; and it was in her nature strongly to\r\n",
      "object to such concealment. She begged leave for her daughters to sit\r\n",
      "with their father, and drove into the town to pay some visits,\r\n",
      "conjecturing that if anything were known to have gone wrong in Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s affairs, she should see or hear some sign of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She called on Mrs. Thesiger, who was not at home, and then drove to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Hackbutt’s on the other side of the churchyard. Mrs. Hackbutt saw\r\n",
      "her coming from an up-stairs window, and remembering her former alarm\r\n",
      "lest she should meet Mrs. Bulstrode, felt almost bound in consistency\r\n",
      "to send word that she was not at home; but against that, there was a\r\n",
      "sudden strong desire within her for the excitement of an interview in\r\n",
      "which she was quite determined not to make the slightest allusion to\r\n",
      "what was in her mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hence Mrs. Bulstrode was shown into the drawing-room, and Mrs. Hackbutt\r\n",
      "went to her, with more tightness of lip and rubbing of her hands than\r\n",
      "was usually observable in her, these being precautions adopted against\r\n",
      "freedom of speech. She was resolved not to ask how Mr. Bulstrode was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have not been anywhere except to church for nearly a week,” said\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bulstrode, after a few introductory remarks. “But Mr. Bulstrode\r\n",
      "was taken so ill at the meeting on Thursday that I have not liked to\r\n",
      "leave the house.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Hackbutt rubbed the back of one hand with the palm of the other\r\n",
      "held against her chest, and let her eyes ramble over the pattern on the\r\n",
      "rug.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was Mr. Hackbutt at the meeting?” persevered Mrs. Bulstrode.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, he was,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, with the same attitude. “The land is\r\n",
      "to be bought by subscription, I believe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let us hope that there will be no more cases of cholera to be buried\r\n",
      "in it,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “It is an awful visitation. But I always\r\n",
      "think Middlemarch a very healthy spot. I suppose it is being used to it\r\n",
      "from a child; but I never saw the town I should like to live at better,\r\n",
      "and especially our end.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure I should be glad that you always should live at Middlemarch,\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bulstrode,” said Mrs. Hackbutt, with a slight sigh. “Still, we\r\n",
      "must learn to resign ourselves, wherever our lot may be cast. Though I\r\n",
      "am sure there will always be people in this town who will wish you\r\n",
      "well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Hackbutt longed to say, “if you take my advice you will part from\r\n",
      "your husband,” but it seemed clear to her that the poor woman knew\r\n",
      "nothing of the thunder ready to bolt on her head, and she herself could\r\n",
      "do no more than prepare her a little. Mrs. Bulstrode felt suddenly\r\n",
      "rather chill and trembling: there was evidently something unusual\r\n",
      "behind this speech of Mrs. Hackbutt’s; but though she had set out with\r\n",
      "the desire to be fully informed, she found herself unable now to pursue\r\n",
      "her brave purpose, and turning the conversation by an inquiry about the\r\n",
      "young Hackbutts, she soon took her leave saying that she was going to\r\n",
      "see Mrs. Plymdale. On her way thither she tried to imagine that there\r\n",
      "might have been some unusually warm sparring at the meeting between Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode and some of his frequent opponents—perhaps Mr. Hackbutt might\r\n",
      "have been one of them. That would account for everything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when she was in conversation with Mrs. Plymdale that comforting\r\n",
      "explanation seemed no longer tenable. “Selina” received her with a\r\n",
      "pathetic affectionateness and a disposition to give edifying answers on\r\n",
      "the commonest topics, which could hardly have reference to an ordinary\r\n",
      "quarrel of which the most important consequence was a perturbation of\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode’s health. Beforehand Mrs. Bulstrode had thought that she\r\n",
      "would sooner question Mrs. Plymdale than any one else; but she found to\r\n",
      "her surprise that an old friend is not always the person whom it is\r\n",
      "easiest to make a confidant of: there was the barrier of remembered\r\n",
      "communication under other circumstances—there was the dislike of being\r\n",
      "pitied and informed by one who had been long wont to allow her the\r\n",
      "superiority. For certain words of mysterious appropriateness that Mrs.\r\n",
      "Plymdale let fall about her resolution never to turn her back on her\r\n",
      "friends, convinced Mrs. Bulstrode that what had happened must be some\r\n",
      "kind of misfortune, and instead of being able to say with her native\r\n",
      "directness, “What is it that you have in your mind?” she found herself\r\n",
      "anxious to get away before she had heard anything more explicit. She\r\n",
      "began to have an agitating certainty that the misfortune was something\r\n",
      "more than the mere loss of money, being keenly sensitive to the fact\r\n",
      "that Selina now, just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done before, avoided\r\n",
      "noticing what she said about her husband, as they would have avoided\r\n",
      "noticing a personal blemish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She said good-by with nervous haste, and told the coachman to drive to\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy’s warehouse. In that short drive her dread gathered so much\r\n",
      "force from the sense of darkness, that when she entered the private\r\n",
      "counting-house where her brother sat at his desk, her knees trembled\r\n",
      "and her usually florid face was deathly pale. Something of the same\r\n",
      "effect was produced in him by the sight of her: he rose from his seat\r\n",
      "to meet her, took her by the hand, and said, with his impulsive\r\n",
      "rashness—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God help you, Harriet! you know all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That moment was perhaps worse than any which came after. It contained\r\n",
      "that concentrated experience which in great crises of emotion reveals\r\n",
      "the bias of a nature, and is prophetic of the ultimate act which will\r\n",
      "end an intermediate struggle. Without that memory of Raffles she might\r\n",
      "still have thought only of monetary ruin, but now along with her\r\n",
      "brother’s look and words there darted into her mind the idea of some\r\n",
      "guilt in her husband—then, under the working of terror came the image\r\n",
      "of her husband exposed to disgrace—and then, after an instant of\r\n",
      "scorching shame in which she felt only the eyes of the world, with one\r\n",
      "leap of her heart she was at his side in mournful but unreproaching\r\n",
      "fellowship with shame and isolation. All this went on within her in a\r\n",
      "mere flash of time—while she sank into the chair, and raised her eyes\r\n",
      "to her brother, who stood over her. “I know nothing, Walter. What is\r\n",
      "it?” she said, faintly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He told her everything, very inartificially, in slow fragments, making\r\n",
      "her aware that the scandal went much beyond proof, especially as to the\r\n",
      "end of Raffles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“People will talk,” he said. “Even if a man has been acquitted by a\r\n",
      "jury, they’ll talk, and nod and wink—and as far as the world goes, a\r\n",
      "man might often as well be guilty as not. It’s a breakdown blow, and it\r\n",
      "damages Lydgate as much as Bulstrode. I don’t pretend to say what is\r\n",
      "the truth. I only wish we had never heard the name of either Bulstrode\r\n",
      "or Lydgate. You’d better have been a Vincy all your life, and so had\r\n",
      "Rosamond.” Mrs. Bulstrode made no reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you must bear up as well as you can, Harriet. People don’t blame\r\n",
      "_you_. And I’ll stand by you whatever you make up your mind to do,”\r\n",
      "said the brother, with rough but well-meaning affectionateness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give me your arm to the carriage, Walter,” said Mrs. Bulstrode. “I\r\n",
      "feel very weak.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And when she got home she was obliged to say to her daughter, “I am not\r\n",
      "well, my dear; I must go and lie down. Attend to your papa. Leave me in\r\n",
      "quiet. I shall take no dinner.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She locked herself in her room. She needed time to get used to her\r\n",
      "maimed consciousness, her poor lopped life, before she could walk\r\n",
      "steadily to the place allotted her. A new searching light had fallen on\r\n",
      "her husband’s character, and she could not judge him leniently: the\r\n",
      "twenty years in which she had believed in him and venerated him by\r\n",
      "virtue of his concealments came back with particulars that made them\r\n",
      "seem an odious deceit. He had married her with that bad past life\r\n",
      "hidden behind him, and she had no faith left to protest his innocence\r\n",
      "of the worst that was imputed to him. Her honest ostentatious nature\r\n",
      "made the sharing of a merited dishonor as bitter as it could be to any\r\n",
      "mortal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this imperfectly taught woman, whose phrases and habits were an odd\r\n",
      "patchwork, had a loyal spirit within her. The man whose prosperity she\r\n",
      "had shared through nearly half a life, and who had unvaryingly\r\n",
      "cherished her—now that punishment had befallen him it was not possible\r\n",
      "to her in any sense to forsake him. There is a forsaking which still\r\n",
      "sits at the same board and lies on the same couch with the forsaken\r\n",
      "soul, withering it the more by unloving proximity. She knew, when she\r\n",
      "locked her door, that she should unlock it ready to go down to her\r\n",
      "unhappy husband and espouse his sorrow, and say of his guilt, I will\r\n",
      "mourn and not reproach. But she needed time to gather up her strength;\r\n",
      "she needed to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and pride of her\r\n",
      "life. When she had resolved to go down, she prepared herself by some\r\n",
      "little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker; they were\r\n",
      "her way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she\r\n",
      "had begun a new life in which she embraced humiliation. She took off\r\n",
      "all her ornaments and put on a plain black gown, and instead of wearing\r\n",
      "her much-adorned cap and large bows of hair, she brushed her hair down\r\n",
      "and put on a plain bonnet-cap, which made her look suddenly like an\r\n",
      "early Methodist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying\r\n",
      "that she was not well, had spent the time in an agitation equal to\r\n",
      "hers. He had looked forward to her learning the truth from others, and\r\n",
      "had acquiesced in that probability, as something easier to him than any\r\n",
      "confession. But now that he imagined the moment of her knowledge come,\r\n",
      "he awaited the result in anguish. His daughters had been obliged to\r\n",
      "consent to leave him, and though he had allowed some food to be brought\r\n",
      "to him, he had not touched it. He felt himself perishing slowly in\r\n",
      "unpitied misery. Perhaps he should never see his wife’s face with\r\n",
      "affection in it again. And if he turned to God there seemed to be no\r\n",
      "answer but the pressure of retribution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was eight o’clock in the evening before the door opened and his wife\r\n",
      "entered. He dared not look up at her. He sat with his eyes bent down,\r\n",
      "and as she went towards him she thought he looked smaller—he seemed so\r\n",
      "withered and shrunken. A movement of new compassion and old tenderness\r\n",
      "went through her like a great wave, and putting one hand on his which\r\n",
      "rested on the arm of the chair, and the other on his shoulder, she\r\n",
      "said, solemnly but kindly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look up, Nicholas.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half amazed\r\n",
      "for a moment: her pale face, her changed, mourning dress, the trembling\r\n",
      "about her mouth, all said, “I know;” and her hands and eyes rested\r\n",
      "gently on him. He burst out crying and they cried together, she sitting\r\n",
      "at his side. They could not yet speak to each other of the shame which\r\n",
      "she was bearing with him, or of the acts which had brought it down on\r\n",
      "them. His confession was silent, and her promise of faithfulness was\r\n",
      "silent. Open-minded as she was, she nevertheless shrank from the words\r\n",
      "which would have expressed their mutual consciousness, as she would\r\n",
      "have shrunk from flakes of fire. She could not say, “How much is only\r\n",

      "substitute for the happiness he had failed to give her. They were at a\r\n",

      "towards Quallingham—there was no outlook anywhere except in an\r\n",
      "occasional letter from Will Ladislaw. She had felt stung and\r\n",
      "disappointed by Will’s resolution to quit Middlemarch, for in spite of\r\n",
      "what she knew and guessed about his admiration for Dorothea, she\r\n",
      "secretly cherished the belief that he had, or would necessarily come to\r\n",

      "women who live much in the idea that each man they meet would have\r\n",
      "preferred them if the preference had not been hopeless. Mrs. Casaubon\r\n",
      "was all very well; but Will’s interest in her dated before he knew Mrs.\r\n",

      "mixture of playful fault-finding and hyperbolical gallantry, as the\r\n",
      "disguise of a deeper feeling; and in his presence she felt that\r\n",
      "agreeable titillation of vanity and sense of romantic drama which\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s presence had no longer the magic to create. She even\r\n",
      "fancied—what will not men and women fancy in these matters?—that Will\r\n",
      "exaggerated his admiration for Mrs. Casaubon in order to pique herself.\r\n",
      "In this way poor Rosamond’s brain had been busy before Will’s\r\n",
      "departure. He would have made, she thought, a much more suitable\r\n",
      "husband for her than she had found in Lydgate. No notion could have\r\n",
      "been falser than this, for Rosamond’s discontent in her marriage was\r\n",
      "due to the conditions of marriage itself, to its demand for\r\n",
      "self-suppression and tolerance, and not to the nature of her husband;\r\n",
      "but the easy conception of an unreal Better had a sentimental charm\r\n",
      "which diverted her ennui. She constructed a little romance which was to\r\n",
      "vary the flatness of her life: Will Ladislaw was always to be a\r\n",
      "bachelor and live near her, always to be at her command, and have an\r\n",
      "understood though never fully expressed passion for her, which would be\r\n",
      "sending out lambent flames every now and then in interesting scenes.\r\n",
      "His departure had been a proportionate disappointment, and had sadly\r\n",
      "increased her weariness of Middlemarch; but at first she had the\r\n",
      "alternative dream of pleasures in store from her intercourse with the\r\n",
      "family at Quallingham. Since then the troubles of her married life had\r\n",
      "deepened, and the absence of other relief encouraged her regretful\r\n",
      "rumination over that thin romance which she had once fed on. Men and\r\n",
      "women make sad mistakes about their own symptoms, taking their vague\r\n",
      "uneasy longings, sometimes for genius, sometimes for religion, and\r\n",
      "oftener still for a mighty love. Will Ladislaw had written chatty\r\n",
      "letters, half to her and half to Lydgate, and she had replied: their\r\n",
      "separation, she felt, was not likely to be final, and the change she\r\n",
      "now most longed for was that Lydgate should go to live in London;\r\n",
      "everything would be agreeable in London; and she had set to work with\r\n",
      "quiet determination to win this result, when there came a sudden,\r\n",
      "delightful promise which inspirited her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town-hall, and was\r\n",
      "nothing less than a letter from Will Ladislaw to Lydgate, which turned\r\n",
      "indeed chiefly on his new interest in plans of colonization, but\r\n",
      "mentioned incidentally, that he might find it necessary to pay a visit\r\n",
      "to Middlemarch within the next few weeks—a very pleasant necessity, he\r\n",
      "said, almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy. He hoped there was his\r\n",
      "old place on the rug, and a great deal of music in store for him. But\r\n",
      "he was quite uncertain as to the time. While Lydgate was reading the\r\n",
      "letter to Rosamond, her face looked like a reviving flower—it grew\r\n",
      "prettier and more blooming. There was nothing unendurable now: the\r\n",
      "debts were paid, Mr. Ladislaw was coming, and Lydgate would be\r\n",
      "persuaded to leave Middlemarch and settle in London, which was “so\r\n",
      "different from a provincial town.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was a bright bit of morning. But soon the sky became black over\r\n",
      "poor Rosamond. The presence of a new gloom in her husband, about which\r\n",
      "he was entirely reserved towards her—for he dreaded to expose his\r\n",
      "lacerated feeling to her neutrality and misconception—soon received a\r\n",
      "painfully strange explanation, alien to all her previous notions of\r\n",
      "what could affect her happiness. In the new gayety of her spirits,\r\n",
      "thinking that Lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual,\r\n",
      "causing him to leave her remarks unanswered, and evidently to keep out\r\n",
      "of her way as much as possible, she chose, a few days after the\r\n",
      "meeting, and without speaking to him on the subject, to send out notes\r\n",
      "of invitation for a small evening party, feeling convinced that this\r\n",
      "was a judicious step, since people seemed to have been keeping aloof\r\n",
      "from them, and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse. When\r\n",
      "the invitations had been accepted, she would tell Lydgate, and give him\r\n",
      "a wise admonition as to how a medical man should behave to his\r\n",
      "neighbors; for Rosamond had the gravest little airs possible about\r\n",
      "other people’s duties. But all the invitations were declined, and the\r\n",
      "last answer came into Lydgate’s hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is Chichely’s scratch. What is he writing to you about?” said\r\n",
      "Lydgate, wonderingly, as he handed the note to her. She was obliged to\r\n",
      "let him see it, and, looking at her severely, he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why on earth have you been sending out invitations without telling me,\r\n",
      "Rosamond? I beg, I insist that you will not invite any one to this\r\n",
      "house. I suppose you have been inviting others, and they have refused\r\n",
      "too.” She said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you hear me?” thundered Lydgate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, certainly I hear you,” said Rosamond, turning her head aside with\r\n",
      "the movement of a graceful long-necked bird.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate tossed his head without any grace and walked out of the room,\r\n",
      "feeling himself dangerous. Rosamond’s thought was, that he was getting\r\n",
      "more and more unbearable—not that there was any new special reason for\r\n",
      "this peremptoriness. His indisposition to tell her anything in which he\r\n",
      "was sure beforehand that she would not be interested was growing into\r\n",
      "an unreflecting habit, and she was in ignorance of everything connected\r\n",
      "with the thousand pounds except that the loan had come from her uncle\r\n",
      "Bulstrode. Lydgate’s odious humors and their neighbors’ apparent\r\n",
      "avoidance of them had an unaccountable date for her in their relief\r\n",
      "from money difficulties. If the invitations had been accepted she would\r\n",
      "have gone to invite her mamma and the rest, whom she had seen nothing\r\n",
      "of for several days; and she now put on her bonnet to go and inquire\r\n",
      "what had become of them all, suddenly feeling as if there were a\r\n",
      "conspiracy to leave her in isolation with a husband disposed to offend\r\n",
      "everybody. It was after the dinner hour, and she found her father and\r\n",
      "mother seated together alone in the drawing-room. They greeted her with\r\n",
      "sad looks, saying “Well, my dear!” and no more. She had never seen her\r\n",
      "father look so downcast; and seating herself near him she said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there anything the matter, papa?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not answer, but Mrs. Vincy said, “Oh, my dear, have you heard\r\n",
      "nothing? It won’t be long before it reaches you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it anything about Tertius?” said Rosamond, turning pale. The idea\r\n",
      "of trouble immediately connected itself with what had been\r\n",
      "unaccountable to her in him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, my dear, yes. To think of your marrying into this trouble. Debt\r\n",
      "was bad enough, but this will be worse.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stay, stay, Lucy,” said Mr. Vincy. “Have you heard nothing about your\r\n",
      "uncle Bulstrode, Rosamond?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, papa,” said the poor thing, feeling as if trouble were not\r\n",
      "anything she had before experienced, but some invisible power with an\r\n",
      "iron grasp that made her soul faint within her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her father told her everything, saying at the end, “It’s better for you\r\n",
      "to know, my dear. I think Lydgate must leave the town. Things have gone\r\n",
      "against him. I dare say he couldn’t help it. I don’t accuse him of any\r\n",
      "harm,” said Mr. Vincy. He had always before been disposed to find the\r\n",
      "utmost fault with Lydgate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shock to Rosamond was terrible. It seemed to her that no lot could\r\n",
      "be so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the\r\n",
      "centre of infamous suspicions. In many cases it is inevitable that the\r\n",
      "shame is felt to be the worst part of crime; and it would have required\r\n",
      "a great deal of disentangling reflection, such as had never entered\r\n",
      "into Rosamond’s life, for her in these moments to feel that her trouble\r\n",
      "was less than if her husband had been certainly known to have done\r\n",
      "something criminal. All the shame seemed to be there. And she had\r\n",
      "innocently married this man with the belief that he and his family were\r\n",
      "a glory to her! She showed her usual reticence to her parents, and only\r\n",
      "said, that if Lydgate had done as she wished he would have left\r\n",
      "Middlemarch long ago.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She bears it beyond anything,” said her mother when she was gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, thank God!” said Mr. Vincy, who was much broken down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Rosamond went home with a sense of justified repugnance towards her\r\n",
      "husband. What had he really done—how had he really acted? She did not\r\n",
      "know. Why had he not told her everything? He did not speak to her on\r\n",
      "the subject, and of course she could not speak to him. It came into her\r\n",
      "mind once that she would ask her father to let her go home again; but\r\n",
      "dwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her: a\r\n",
      "married woman gone back to live with her parents—life seemed to have no\r\n",
      "meaning for her in such a position: she could not contemplate herself\r\n",
      "in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next two days Lydgate observed a change in her, and believed that\r\n",
      "she had heard the bad news. Would she speak to him about it, or would\r\n",
      "she go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she\r\n",
      "believed him guilty? We must remember that he was in a morbid state of\r\n",
      "mind, in which almost all contact was pain. Certainly Rosamond in this\r\n",
      "case had equal reason to complain of reserve and want of confidence on\r\n",
      "his part; but in the bitterness of his soul he excused himself;—was he\r\n",
      "not justified in shrinking from the task of telling her, since now she\r\n",
      "knew the truth she had no impulse to speak to him? But a deeper-lying\r\n",
      "consciousness that he was in fault made him restless, and the silence\r\n",
      "between them became intolerable to him; it was as if they were both\r\n",
      "adrift on one piece of wreck and looked away from each other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought, “I am a fool. Haven’t I given up expecting anything? I have\r\n",
      "married care, not help.” And that evening he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rosamond, have you heard anything that distresses you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” she answered, laying down her work, which she had been carrying\r\n",
      "on with a languid semi-consciousness, most unlike her usual self.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What have you heard?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Everything, I suppose. Papa told me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That people think me disgraced?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Rosamond, faintly, beginning to sew again automatically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was silence. Lydgate thought, “If she has any trust in me—any\r\n",
      "notion of what I am, she ought to speak now and say that she does not\r\n",
      "believe I have deserved disgrace.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Rosamond on her side went on moving her fingers languidly. Whatever\r\n",
      "was to be said on the subject she expected to come from Tertius. What\r\n",
      "did she know? And if he were innocent of any wrong, why did he not do\r\n",
      "something to clear himself?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This silence of hers brought a new rush of gall to that bitter mood in\r\n",
      "which Lydgate had been saying to himself that nobody believed in\r\n",
      "him—even Farebrother had not come forward. He had begun to question her\r\n",
      "with the intent that their conversation should disperse the chill fog\r\n",
      "which had gathered between them, but he felt his resolution checked by\r\n",
      "despairing resentment. Even this trouble, like the rest, she seemed to\r\n",
      "regard as if it were hers alone. He was always to her a being apart,\r\n",
      "doing what she objected to. He started from his chair with an angry\r\n",
      "impulse, and thrusting his hands in his pockets, walked up and down the\r\n",
      "room. There was an underlying consciousness all the while that he\r\n",
      "should have to master this anger, and tell her everything, and convince\r\n",
      "her of the facts. For he had almost learned the lesson that he must\r\n",
      "bend himself to her nature, and that because she came short in her\r\n",
      "sympathy, he must give the more. Soon he recurred to his intention of\r\n",
      "opening himself: the occasion must not be lost. If he could bring her\r\n",
      "to feel with some solemnity that here was a slander which must be met\r\n",
      "and not run away from, and that the whole trouble had come out of his\r\n",
      "desperate want of money, it would be a moment for urging powerfully on\r\n",
      "her that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little money\r\n",
      "as possible, so that they might weather the bad time and keep\r\n",
      "themselves independent. He would mention the definite measures which he\r\n",
      "desired to take, and win her to a willing spirit. He was bound to try\r\n",
      "this—and what else was there for him to do?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not know how long he had been walking uneasily backwards and\r\n",
      "forwards, but Rosamond felt that it was long, and wished that he would\r\n",
      "sit down. She too had begun to think this an opportunity for urging on\r\n",
      "Tertius what he ought to do. Whatever might be the truth about all this\r\n",
      "misery, there was one dread which asserted itself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate at last seated himself, not in his usual chair, but in one\r\n",
      "nearer to Rosamond, leaning aside in it towards her, and looking at her\r\n",
      "gravely before he reopened the sad subject. He had conquered himself so\r\n",
      "far, and was about to speak with a sense of solemnity, as on an\r\n",
      "occasion which was not to be repeated. He had even opened his lips,\r\n",
      "when Rosamond, letting her hands fall, looked at him and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Surely, Tertius—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Surely now at last you have given up the idea of staying in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch. I cannot go on living here. Let us go to London. Papa, and\r\n",
      "every one else, says you had better go. Whatever misery I have to put\r\n",
      "up with, it will be easier away from here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate felt miserably jarred. Instead of that critical outpouring for\r\n",
      "which he had prepared himself with effort, here was the old round to be\r\n",
      "gone through again. He could not bear it. With a quick change of\r\n",
      "countenance he rose and went out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps if he had been strong enough to persist in his determination to\r\n",
      "be the more because she was less, that evening might have had a better\r\n",
      "issue. If his energy could have borne down that check, he might still\r\n",

      "The beginning of mutual understanding and resolve seemed as far off as\r\n",
      "ever; nay, it seemed blocked out by the sense of unsuccessful effort.\r\n",
      "They lived on from day to day with their thoughts still apart, Lydgate\r\n",
      "going about what work he had in a mood of despair, and Rosamond\r\n",
      "feeling, with some justification, that he was behaving cruelly. It was\r\n",
      "of no use to say anything to Tertius; but when Will Ladislaw came, she\r\n",

      "Some days later, Lydgate was riding to Lowick Manor, in consequence of\r\n",
      "a summons from Dorothea. The summons had not been unexpected, since it\r\n",
      "had followed a letter from Mr. Bulstrode, in which he stated that he\r\n",
      "had resumed his arrangements for quitting Middlemarch, and must remind\r\n",
      "Lydgate of his previous communications about the Hospital, to the\r\n",
      "purport of which he still adhered. It had been his duty, before taking\r\n",
      "further steps, to reopen the subject with Mrs. Casaubon, who now\r\n",
      "wished, as before, to discuss the question with Lydgate. “Your views\r\n",
      "may possibly have undergone some change,” wrote Mr. Bulstrode; “but, in\r\n",
      "that case also, it is desirable that you should lay them before her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea awaited his arrival with eager interest. Though, in deference\r\n",
      "to her masculine advisers, she had refrained from what Sir James had\r\n",
      "called “interfering in this Bulstrode business,” the hardship of\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s position was continually in her mind, and when Bulstrode\r\n",
      "applied to her again about the hospital, she felt that the opportunity\r\n",
      "was come to her which she had been hindered from hastening. In her\r\n",
      "luxurious home, wandering under the boughs of her own great trees, her\r\n",
      "thought was going out over the lot of others, and her emotions were\r\n",
      "imprisoned. The idea of some active good within her reach, “haunted her\r\n",
      "like a passion,” and another’s need having once come to her as a\r\n",
      "distinct image, preoccupied her desire with the yearning to give\r\n",
      "relief, and made her own ease tasteless. She was full of confident hope\r\n",
      "about this interview with Lydgate, never heeding what was said of his\r\n",
      "personal reserve; never heeding that she was a very young woman.\r\n",
      "Nothing could have seemed more irrelevant to Dorothea than insistence\r\n",
      "on her youth and sex when she was moved to show her human fellowship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she sat waiting in the library, she could do nothing but live\r\n",
      "through again all the past scenes which had brought Lydgate into her\r\n",
      "memories. They all owed their significance to her marriage and its\r\n",
      "troubles—but no; there were two occasions in which the image of Lydgate\r\n",
      "had come painfully in connection with his wife and some one else. The\r\n",
      "pain had been allayed for Dorothea, but it had left in her an awakened\r\n",
      "conjecture as to what Lydgate’s marriage might be to him, a\r\n",
      "susceptibility to the slightest hint about Mrs. Lydgate. These thoughts\r\n",
      "were like a drama to her, and made her eyes bright, and gave an\r\n",
      "attitude of suspense to her whole frame, though she was only looking\r\n",
      "out from the brown library on to the turf and the bright green buds\r\n",
      "which stood in relief against the dark evergreens.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Lydgate came in, she was almost shocked at the change in his face,\r\n",
      "which was strikingly perceptible to her who had not seen him for two\r\n",
      "months. It was not the change of emaciation, but that effect which even\r\n",
      "young faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of\r\n",
      "resentment and despondency. Her cordial look, when she put out her hand\r\n",
      "to him, softened his expression, but only with melancholy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have wished very much to see you for a long while, Mr. Lydgate,”\r\n",
      "said Dorothea when they were seated opposite each other; “but I put off\r\n",
      "asking you to come until Mr. Bulstrode applied to me again about the\r\n",
      "Hospital. I know that the advantage of keeping the management of it\r\n",
      "separate from that of the Infirmary depends on you, or, at least, on\r\n",
      "the good which you are encouraged to hope for from having it under your\r\n",
      "control. And I am sure you will not refuse to tell me exactly what you\r\n",
      "think.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You want to decide whether you should give a generous support to the\r\n",
      "Hospital,” said Lydgate. “I cannot conscientiously advise you to do it\r\n",
      "in dependence on any activity of mine. I may be obliged to leave the\r\n",
      "town.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He spoke curtly, feeling the ache of despair as to his being able to\r\n",
      "carry out any purpose that Rosamond had set her mind against.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not because there is no one to believe in you?” said Dorothea, pouring\r\n",
      "out her words in clearness from a full heart. “I know the unhappy\r\n",
      "mistakes about you. I knew them from the first moment to be mistakes.\r\n",
      "You have never done anything vile. You would not do anything\r\n",
      "dishonorable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the first assurance of belief in him that had fallen on\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s ears. He drew a deep breath, and said, “Thank you.” He could\r\n",
      "say no more: it was something very new and strange in his life that\r\n",
      "these few words of trust from a woman should be so much to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I beseech you to tell me how everything was,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "fearlessly. “I am sure that the truth would clear you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate started up from his chair and went towards the window,\r\n",
      "forgetting where he was. He had so often gone over in his mind the\r\n",
      "possibility of explaining everything without aggravating appearances\r\n",
      "that would tell, perhaps unfairly, against Bulstrode, and had so often\r\n",
      "decided against it—he had so often said to himself that his assertions\r\n",
      "would not change people’s impressions—that Dorothea’s words sounded\r\n",
      "like a temptation to do something which in his soberness he had\r\n",
      "pronounced to be unreasonable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell me, pray,” said Dorothea, with simple earnestness; “then we can\r\n",
      "consult together. It is wicked to let people think evil of any one\r\n",
      "falsely, when it can be hindered.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate turned, remembering where he was, and saw Dorothea’s face\r\n",
      "looking up at him with a sweet trustful gravity. The presence of a\r\n",
      "noble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes\r\n",
      "the lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger,\r\n",
      "quieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in\r\n",
      "the wholeness of our character. That influence was beginning to act on\r\n",
      "Lydgate, who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is\r\n",
      "dragged and struggling amid the throng. He sat down again, and felt\r\n",
      "that he was recovering his old self in the consciousness that he was\r\n",
      "with one who believed in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t want,” he said, “to bear hard on Bulstrode, who has lent me\r\n",
      "money of which I was in need—though I would rather have gone without it\r\n",
      "now. He is hunted down and miserable, and has only a poor thread of\r\n",
      "life in him. But I should like to tell you everything. It will be a\r\n",
      "comfort to me to speak where belief has gone beforehand, and where I\r\n",
      "shall not seem to be offering assertions of my own honesty. You will\r\n",
      "feel what is fair to another, as you feel what is fair to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do trust me,” said Dorothea; “I will not repeat anything without your\r\n",
      "leave. But at the very least, I could say that you have made all the\r\n",
      "circumstances clear to me, and that I know you are not in any way\r\n",
      "guilty. Mr. Farebrother would believe me, and my uncle, and Sir James\r\n",
      "Chettam. Nay, there are persons in Middlemarch to whom I could go;\r\n",
      "although they don’t know much of me, they would believe me. They would\r\n",
      "know that I could have no other motive than truth and justice. I would\r\n",
      "take any pains to clear you. I have very little to do. There is nothing\r\n",
      "better that I can do in the world.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s voice, as she made this childlike picture of what she would\r\n",
      "do, might have been almost taken as a proof that she could do it\r\n",
      "effectively. The searching tenderness of her woman’s tones seemed made\r\n",
      "for a defence against ready accusers. Lydgate did not stay to think\r\n",
      "that she was Quixotic: he gave himself up, for the first time in his\r\n",
      "life, to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely on a generous\r\n",
      "sympathy, without any check of proud reserve. And he told her\r\n",
      "everything, from the time when, under the pressure of his difficulties,\r\n",
      "he unwillingly made his first application to Bulstrode; gradually, in\r\n",
      "the relief of speaking, getting into a more thorough utterance of what\r\n",
      "had gone on in his mind—entering fully into the fact that his treatment\r\n",
      "of the patient was opposed to the dominant practice, into his doubts at\r\n",
      "the last, his ideal of medical duty, and his uneasy consciousness that\r\n",
      "the acceptance of the money had made some difference in his private\r\n",
      "inclination and professional behavior, though not in his fulfilment of\r\n",
      "any publicly recognized obligation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It has come to my knowledge since,” he added, “that Hawley sent some\r\n",
      "one to examine the housekeeper at Stone Court, and she said that she\r\n",
      "gave the patient all the opium in the phial I left, as well as a good\r\n",
      "deal of brandy. But that would not have been opposed to ordinary\r\n",
      "prescriptions, even of first-rate men. The suspicions against me had no\r\n",
      "hold there: they are grounded on the knowledge that I took money, that\r\n",
      "Bulstrode had strong motives for wishing the man to die, and that he\r\n",
      "gave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or other\r\n",
      "against the patient—that in any case I accepted a bribe to hold my\r\n",
      "tongue. They are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately,\r\n",
      "because they lie in people’s inclination and can never be disproved.\r\n",
      "How my orders came to be disobeyed is a question to which I don’t know\r\n",
      "the answer. It is still possible that Bulstrode was innocent of any\r\n",
      "criminal intention—even possible that he had nothing to do with the\r\n",
      "disobedience, and merely abstained from mentioning it. But all that has\r\n",
      "nothing to do with the public belief. It is one of those cases on which\r\n",
      "a man is condemned on the ground of his character—it is believed that\r\n",
      "he has committed a crime in some undefined way, because he had the\r\n",
      "motive for doing it; and Bulstrode’s character has enveloped me,\r\n",
      "because I took his money. I am simply blighted—like a damaged ear of\r\n",
      "corn—the business is done and can’t be undone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, it is hard!” said Dorothea. “I understand the difficulty there is\r\n",
      "in your vindicating yourself. And that all this should have come to you\r\n",
      "who had meant to lead a higher life than the common, and to find out\r\n",
      "better ways—I cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable. I know you\r\n",
      "meant that. I remember what you said to me when you first spoke to me\r\n",
      "about the hospital. There is no sorrow I have thought more about than\r\n",
      "that—to love what is great, and try to reach it, and yet to fail.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Lydgate, feeling that here he had found room for the full\r\n",
      "meaning of his grief. “I had some ambition. I meant everything to be\r\n",
      "different with me. I thought I had more strength and mastery. But the\r\n",
      "most terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except oneself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Suppose,” said Dorothea, meditatively,—“suppose we kept on the\r\n",
      "Hospital according to the present plan, and you stayed here though only\r\n",
      "with the friendship and support of a few, the evil feeling towards you\r\n",
      "would gradually die out; there would come opportunities in which people\r\n",
      "would be forced to acknowledge that they had been unjust to you,\r\n",
      "because they would see that your purposes were pure. You may still win\r\n",
      "a great fame like the Louis and Laennec I have heard you speak of, and\r\n",
      "we shall all be proud of you,” she ended, with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That might do if I had my old trust in myself,” said Lydgate,\r\n",
      "mournfully. “Nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round and\r\n",
      "running away before this slander, leaving it unchecked behind me.\r\n",
      "Still, I can’t ask any one to put a great deal of money into a plan\r\n",
      "which depends on me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would be quite worth my while,” said Dorothea, simply. “Only think.\r\n",
      "I am very uncomfortable with my money, because they tell me I have too\r\n",
      "little for any great scheme of the sort I like best, and yet I have too\r\n",
      "much. I don’t know what to do. I have seven hundred a-year of my own\r\n",
      "fortune, and nineteen hundred a-year that Mr. Casaubon left me, and\r\n",
      "between three and four thousand of ready money in the bank. I wished to\r\n",
      "raise money and pay it off gradually out of my income which I don’t\r\n",
      "want, to buy land with and found a village which should be a school of\r\n",
      "industry; but Sir James and my uncle have convinced me that the risk\r\n",
      "would be too great. So you see that what I should most rejoice at would\r\n",
      "be to have something good to do with my money: I should like it to make\r\n",
      "other people’s lives better to them. It makes me very uneasy—coming all\r\n",
      "to me who don’t want it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A smile broke through the gloom of Lydgate’s face. The childlike\r\n",
      "grave-eyed earnestness with which Dorothea said all this was\r\n",
      "irresistible—blent into an adorable whole with her ready understanding\r\n",
      "of high experience. (Of lower experience such as plays a great part in\r\n",
      "the world, poor Mrs. Casaubon had a very blurred shortsighted\r\n",
      "knowledge, little helped by her imagination.) But she took the smile as\r\n",
      "encouragement of her plan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously,” she said, in a\r\n",
      "tone of persuasion. “The hospital would be one good; and making your\r\n",
      "life quite whole and well again would be another.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s smile had died away. “You have the goodness as well as the\r\n",
      "money to do all that; if it could be done,” he said. “But—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He hesitated a little while, looking vaguely towards the window; and\r\n",
      "she sat in silent expectation. At last he turned towards her and said\r\n",
      "impetuously—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should I not tell you?—you know what sort of bond marriage is. You\r\n",
      "will understand everything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt her heart beginning to beat faster. Had he that sorrow\r\n",
      "too? But she feared to say any word, and he went on immediately.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is impossible for me now to do anything—to take any step without\r\n",
      "considering my wife’s happiness. The thing that I might like to do if I\r\n",
      "were alone, is become impossible to me. I can’t see her miserable. She\r\n",
      "married me without knowing what she was going into, and it might have\r\n",
      "been better for her if she had not married me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know, I know—you could not give her pain, if you were not obliged to\r\n",
      "do it,” said Dorothea, with keen memory of her own life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And she has set her mind against staying. She wishes to go. The\r\n",
      "troubles she has had here have wearied her,” said Lydgate, breaking off\r\n",
      "again, lest he should say too much.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But when she saw the good that might come of staying—” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "remonstrantly, looking at Lydgate as if he had forgotten the reasons\r\n",
      "which had just been considered. He did not speak immediately.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She would not see it,” he said at last, curtly, feeling at first that\r\n",
      "this statement must do without explanation. “And, indeed, I have lost\r\n",
      "all spirit about carrying on my life here.” He paused a moment and\r\n",
      "then, following the impulse to let Dorothea see deeper into the\r\n",
      "difficulty of his life, he said, “The fact is, this trouble has come\r\n",
      "upon her confusedly. We have not been able to speak to each other about\r\n",
      "it. I am not sure what is in her mind about it: she may fear that I\r\n",
      "have really done something base. It is my fault; I ought to be more\r\n",
      "open. But I have been suffering cruelly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I go and see her?” said Dorothea, eagerly. “Would she accept my\r\n",
      "sympathy? I would tell her that you have not been blamable before any\r\n",
      "one’s judgment but your own. I would tell her that you shall be cleared\r\n",
      "in every fair mind. I would cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may\r\n",
      "go to see her? I did see her once.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure you may,” said Lydgate, seizing the proposition with some\r\n",
      "hope. “She would feel honored—cheered, I think, by the proof that you\r\n",
      "at least have some respect for me. I will not speak to her about your\r\n",
      "coming—that she may not connect it with my wishes at all. I know very\r\n",
      "well that I ought not to have left anything to be told her by others,\r\n",
      "but—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He broke off, and there was a moment’s silence. Dorothea refrained from\r\n",
      "saying what was in her mind—how well she knew that there might be\r\n",
      "invisible barriers to speech between husband and wife. This was a point\r\n",
      "on which even sympathy might make a wound. She returned to the more\r\n",
      "outward aspect of Lydgate’s position, saying cheerfully—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And if Mrs. Lydgate knew that there were friends who would believe in\r\n",
      "you and support you, she might then be glad that you should stay in\r\n",
      "your place and recover your hopes—and do what you meant to do. Perhaps\r\n",
      "then you would see that it was right to agree with what I proposed\r\n",
      "about your continuing at the Hospital. Surely you would, if you still\r\n",
      "have faith in it as a means of making your knowledge useful?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate did not answer, and she saw that he was debating with himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You need not decide immediately,” she said, gently. “A few days hence\r\n",
      "it will be early enough for me to send my answer to Mr. Bulstrode.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate still waited, but at last turned to speak in his most decisive\r\n",
      "tones.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; I prefer that there should be no interval left for wavering. I am\r\n",
      "no longer sure enough of myself—I mean of what it would be possible for\r\n",
      "me to do under the changed circumstances of my life. It would be\r\n",
      "dishonorable to let others engage themselves to anything serious in\r\n",
      "dependence on me. I might be obliged to go away after all; I see little\r\n",
      "chance of anything else. The whole thing is too problematic; I cannot\r\n",
      "consent to be the cause of your goodness being wasted. No—let the new\r\n",
      "Hospital be joined with the old Infirmary, and everything go on as it\r\n",
      "might have done if I had never come. I have kept a valuable register\r\n",
      "since I have been there; I shall send it to a man who will make use of\r\n",
      "it,” he ended bitterly. “I can think of nothing for a long while but\r\n",
      "getting an income.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It hurts me very much to hear you speak so hopelessly,” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "“It would be a happiness to your friends, who believe in your future,\r\n",
      "in your power to do great things, if you would let them save you from\r\n",
      "that. Think how much money I have; it would be like taking a burthen\r\n",
      "from me if you took some of it every year till you got free from this\r\n",
      "fettering want of income. Why should not people do these things? It is\r\n",
      "so difficult to make shares at all even. This is one way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God bless you, Mrs. Casaubon!” said Lydgate, rising as if with the\r\n",
      "same impulse that made his words energetic, and resting his arm on the\r\n",
      "back of the great leather chair he had been sitting in. “It is good\r\n",
      "that you should have such feelings. But I am not the man who ought to\r\n",
      "allow himself to benefit by them. I have not given guarantees enough. I\r\n",
      "must not at least sink into the degradation of being pensioned for work\r\n",
      "that I never achieved. It is very clear to me that I must not count on\r\n",
      "anything else than getting away from Middlemarch as soon as I can\r\n",
      "manage it. I should not be able for a long while, at the very best, to\r\n",
      "get an income here, and—and it is easier to make necessary changes in a\r\n",
      "new place. I must do as other men do, and think what will please the\r\n",
      "world and bring in money; look for a little opening in the London\r\n",
      "crowd, and push myself; set up in a watering-place, or go to some\r\n",
      "southern town where there are plenty of idle English, and get myself\r\n",
      "puffed,—that is the sort of shell I must creep into and try to keep my\r\n",
      "soul alive in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now that is not brave,” said Dorothea,—“to give up the fight.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, it is not brave,” said Lydgate, “but if a man is afraid of\r\n",
      "creeping paralysis?” Then, in another tone, “Yet you have made a great\r\n",
      "difference in my courage by believing in me. Everything seems more\r\n",
      "bearable since I have talked to you; and if you can clear me in a few\r\n",
      "other minds, especially in Farebrother’s, I shall be deeply grateful.\r\n",
      "The point I wish you not to mention is the fact of disobedience to my\r\n",
      "orders. That would soon get distorted. After all, there is no evidence\r\n",
      "for me but people’s opinion of me beforehand. You can only repeat my\r\n",
      "own report of myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Farebrother will believe—others will believe,” said Dorothea. “I\r\n",
      "can say of you what will make it stupidity to suppose that you would be\r\n",
      "bribed to do a wickedness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know,” said Lydgate, with something like a groan in his voice.\r\n",
      "“I have not taken a bribe yet. But there is a pale shade of bribery\r\n",
      "which is sometimes called prosperity. You will do me another great\r\n",
      "kindness, then, and come to see my wife?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I will. I remember how pretty she is,” said Dorothea, into whose\r\n",
      "mind every impression about Rosamond had cut deep. “I hope she will\r\n",
      "like me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Lydgate rode away, he thought, “This young creature has a heart\r\n",
      "large enough for the Virgin Mary. She evidently thinks nothing of her\r\n",
      "own future, and would pledge away half her income at once, as if she\r\n",
      "wanted nothing for herself but a chair to sit in from which she can\r\n",
      "look down with those clear eyes at the poor mortals who pray to her.\r\n",
      "She seems to have what I never saw in any woman before—a fountain of\r\n",
      "friendship towards men—a man can make a friend of her. Casaubon must\r\n",

      "music stool with her white fingers suspended on the wooden front, and\r\n",
      "looking before her in dreamy ennui. Her melancholy had become so marked\r\n",

      "sometimes sat the whole day when Lydgate was out—equipped for a walk in\r\n",
      "the town. She had a letter to post—a letter addressed to Mr. Ladislaw\r\n",
      "and written with charming discretion, but intended to hasten his\r\n",
      "arrival by a hint of trouble. The servant-maid, their sole\r\n",
      "house-servant now, noticed her coming down-stairs in her walking dress,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Dorothea’s mind was filled with her project of going to\r\n",
      "Rosamond, and with the many thoughts, both of the past and the probable\r\n",
      "future, which gathered round the idea of that visit. Until yesterday\r\n",
      "when Lydgate had opened to her a glimpse of some trouble in his married\r\n",
      "life, the image of Mrs. Lydgate had always been associated for her with\r\n",
      "that of Will Ladislaw. Even in her most uneasy moments—even when she\r\n",
      "had been agitated by Mrs. Cadwallader’s painfully graphic report of\r\n",
      "gossip—her effort, nay, her strongest impulsive prompting, had been\r\n",
      "towards the vindication of Will from any sullying surmises; and when,\r\n",
      "in her meeting with him afterwards, she had at first interpreted his\r\n",
      "words as a probable allusion to a feeling towards Mrs. Lydgate which he\r\n",
      "was determined to cut himself off from indulging, she had had a quick,\r\n",
      "sad, excusing vision of the charm there might be in his constant\r\n",
      "opportunities of companionship with that fair creature, who most likely\r\n",
      "shared his other tastes as she evidently did his delight in music. But\r\n",
      "there had followed his parting words—the few passionate words in which\r\n",
      "he had implied that she herself was the object of whom his love held\r\n",
      "him in dread, that it was his love for her only which he was resolved\r\n",
      "not to declare but to carry away into banishment. From the time of that\r\n",
      "parting, Dorothea, believing in Will’s love for her, believing with a\r\n",
      "proud delight in his delicate sense of honor and his determination that\r\n",
      "no one should impeach him justly, felt her heart quite at rest as to\r\n",
      "the regard he might have for Mrs. Lydgate. She was sure that the regard\r\n",
      "was blameless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are natures in which, if they love us, we are conscious of having\r\n",
      "a sort of baptism and consecration: they bind us over to rectitude and\r\n",
      "purity by their pure belief about us; and our sins become that worst\r\n",
      "kind of sacrilege which tears down the invisible altar of trust. “If\r\n",
      "you are not good, none is good”—those little words may give a terrific\r\n",
      "meaning to responsibility, may hold a vitriolic intensity for remorse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s nature was of that kind: her own passionate faults lay along\r\n",
      "the easily counted open channels of her ardent character; and while she\r\n",
      "was full of pity for the visible mistakes of others, she had not yet\r\n",
      "any material within her experience for subtle constructions and\r\n",
      "suspicions of hidden wrong. But that simplicity of hers, holding up an\r\n",
      "ideal for others in her believing conception of them, was one of the\r\n",
      "great powers of her womanhood. And it had from the first acted strongly\r\n",
      "on Will Ladislaw. He felt, when he parted from her, that the brief\r\n",
      "words by which he had tried to convey to her his feeling about herself\r\n",
      "and the division which her fortune made between them, would only profit\r\n",
      "by their brevity when Dorothea had to interpret them: he felt that in\r\n",
      "her mind he had found his highest estimate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he was right there. In the months since their parting Dorothea had\r\n",
      "felt a delicious though sad repose in their relation to each other, as\r\n",
      "one which was inwardly whole and without blemish. She had an active\r\n",
      "force of antagonism within her, when the antagonism turned on the\r\n",
      "defence either of plans or persons that she believed in; and the wrongs\r\n",
      "which she felt that Will had received from her husband, and the\r\n",
      "external conditions which to others were grounds for slighting him,\r\n",
      "only gave the more tenacity to her affection and admiring judgment. And\r\n",
      "now with the disclosures about Bulstrode had come another fact\r\n",
      "affecting Will’s social position, which roused afresh Dorothea’s inward\r\n",
      "resistance to what was said about him in that part of her world which\r\n",
      "lay within park palings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Young Ladislaw the grandson of a thieving Jew pawnbroker” was a phrase\r\n",

      "placard on poor Will’s back than the “Italian with white mice.” Upright\r\n",
      "Sir James Chettam was convinced that his own satisfaction was righteous\r\n",
      "when he thought with some complacency that here was an added league to\r\n",
      "that mountainous distance between Ladislaw and Dorothea, which enabled\r\n",
      "him to dismiss any anxiety in that direction as too absurd. And perhaps\r\n",
      "there had been some pleasure in pointing Mr. Brooke’s attention to this\r\n",
      "ugly bit of Ladislaw’s genealogy, as a fresh candle for him to see his\r\n",
      "own folly by. Dorothea had observed the animus with which Will’s part\r\n",
      "in the painful story had been recalled more than once; but she had\r\n",
      "uttered no word, being checked now, as she had not been formerly in\r\n",
      "speaking of Will, by the consciousness of a deeper relation between\r\n",
      "them which must always remain in consecrated secrecy. But her silence\r\n",
      "shrouded her resistant emotion into a more thorough glow; and this\r\n",
      "misfortune in Will’s lot which, it seemed, others were wishing to fling\r\n",
      "at his back as an opprobrium, only gave something more of enthusiasm to\r\n",
      "her clinging thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She entertained no visions of their ever coming into nearer union, and\r\n",
      "yet she had taken no posture of renunciation. She had accepted her\r\n",
      "whole relation to Will very simply as part of her marriage sorrows, and\r\n",
      "would have thought it very sinful in her to keep up an inward wail\r\n",
      "because she was not completely happy, being rather disposed to dwell on\r\n",
      "the superfluities of her lot. She could bear that the chief pleasures\r\n",
      "of her tenderness should lie in memory, and the idea of marriage came\r\n",
      "to her solely as a repulsive proposition from some suitor of whom she\r\n",
      "at present knew nothing, but whose merits, as seen by her friends,\r\n",
      "would be a source of torment to her:—“somebody who will manage your\r\n",
      "property for you, my dear,” was Mr. Brooke’s attractive suggestion of\r\n",
      "suitable characteristics. “I should like to manage it myself, if I knew\r\n",
      "what to do with it,” said Dorothea. No—she adhered to her declaration\r\n",
      "that she would never be married again, and in the long valley of her\r\n",
      "life which looked so flat and empty of waymarks, guidance would come as\r\n",
      "she walked along the road, and saw her fellow-passengers by the way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This habitual state of feeling about Will Ladislaw had been strong in\r\n",
      "all her waking hours since she had proposed to pay a visit to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Lydgate, making a sort of background against which she saw Rosamond’s\r\n",
      "figure presented to her without hindrances to her interest and\r\n",
      "compassion. There was evidently some mental separation, some barrier to\r\n",
      "complete confidence which had arisen between this wife and the husband\r\n",
      "who had yet made her happiness a law to him. That was a trouble which\r\n",
      "no third person must directly touch. But Dorothea thought with deep\r\n",
      "pity of the loneliness which must have come upon Rosamond from the\r\n",
      "suspicions cast on her husband; and there would surely be help in the\r\n",
      "manifestation of respect for Lydgate and sympathy with her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall talk to her about her husband,” thought Dorothea, as she was\r\n",
      "being driven towards the town. The clear spring morning, the scent of\r\n",
      "the moist earth, the fresh leaves just showing their creased-up wealth\r\n",
      "of greenery from out their half-opened sheaths, seemed part of the\r\n",
      "cheerfulness she was feeling from a long conversation with Mr.\r\n",

      "Dorothea had another errand in Lowick Gate: it was about a new\r\n",
      "fine-toned bell for the school-house, and as she had to get out of her\r\n",
      "carriage very near to Lydgate’s, she walked thither across the street,\r\n",
      "having told the coachman to wait for some packages. The street door was\r\n",
      "open, and the servant was taking the opportunity of looking out at the\r\n",

      "that the lady who “belonged to it” was coming towards her.\r\n",

      "collected enough to be sure that “mum” was not the right title for this\r\n",
      "queenly young widow with a carriage and pair. “Will you please to walk\r\n",
      "in, and I’ll go and see.”\r\n",

      "see if Rosamond had returned from her walk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They crossed the broader part of the entrance-hall, and turned up the\r\n",
      "passage which led to the garden. The drawing-room door was unlatched,\r\n",
      "and Martha, pushing it without looking into the room, waited for Mrs.\r\n",

      "filled with images of things as they had been and were going to be. She\r\n",
      "found herself on the other side of the door without seeing anything\r\n",
      "remarkable, but immediately she heard a voice speaking in low tones\r\n",
      "which startled her as with a sense of dreaming in daylight, and\r\n",
      "advancing unconsciously a step or two beyond the projecting slab of a\r\n",
      "bookcase, she saw, in the terrible illumination of a certainty which\r\n",
      "filled up all outlines, something which made her pause, motionless,\r\n",
      "without self-possession enough to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seated with his back towards her on a sofa which stood against the wall\r\n",
      "on a line with the door by which she had entered, she saw Will\r\n",
      "Ladislaw: close by him and turned towards him with a flushed\r\n",
      "tearfulness which gave a new brilliancy to her face sat Rosamond, her\r\n",
      "bonnet hanging back, while Will leaning towards her clasped both her\r\n",
      "upraised hands in his and spoke with low-toned fervor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond in her agitated absorption had not noticed the silently\r\n",
      "advancing figure; but when Dorothea, after the first immeasurable\r\n",
      "instant of this vision, moved confusedly backward and found herself\r\n",
      "impeded by some piece of furniture, Rosamond was suddenly aware of her\r\n",
      "presence, and with a spasmodic movement snatched away her hands and\r\n",
      "rose, looking at Dorothea who was necessarily arrested. Will Ladislaw,\r\n",
      "starting up, looked round also, and meeting Dorothea’s eyes with a new\r\n",
      "lightning in them, seemed changing to marble. But she immediately\r\n",
      "turned them away from him to Rosamond and said in a firm voice—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate, the servant did not know that you were here.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She laid down the letter on the small table which had checked her\r\n",
      "retreat, and then including Rosamond and Will in one distant glance and\r\n",
      "bow, she went quickly out of the room, meeting in the passage the\r\n",
      "surprised Martha, who said she was sorry the mistress was not at home,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Drive on to Freshitt Hall,” she said to the coachman, and any one\r\n",
      "looking at her might have thought that though she was paler than usual\r\n",
      "she was never animated by a more self-possessed energy. And that was\r\n",
      "really her experience. It was as if she had drunk a great draught of\r\n",
      "scorn that stimulated her beyond the susceptibility to other feelings.\r\n",
      "She had seen something so far below her belief, that her emotions\r\n",
      "rushed back from it and made an excited throng without an object. She\r\n",
      "needed something active to turn her excitement out upon. She felt power\r\n",
      "to walk and work for a day, without meat or drink. And she would carry\r\n",
      "out the purpose with which she had started in the morning, of going to\r\n",
      "Freshitt and Tipton to tell Sir James and her uncle all that she wished\r\n",
      "them to know about Lydgate, whose married loneliness under his trial\r\n",
      "now presented itself to her with new significance, and made her more\r\n",

      "like this triumphant power of indignation in the struggle of her\r\n",
      "married life, in which there had always been a quickly subduing pang;\r\n",
      "and she took it as a sign of new strength.\r\n",

      "seated herself, untying her hanging bonnet and laying it down with her\r\n",
      "shawl. Her little hands which she folded before her were very cold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It would have been safer for Will in the first instance to have taken\r\n",
      "up his hat and gone away; but he had felt no impulse to do this; on the\r\n",
      "contrary, he had a horrible inclination to stay and shatter Rosamond\r\n",
      "with his anger. It seemed as impossible to bear the fatality she had\r\n",
      "drawn down on him without venting his fury as it would be to a panther\r\n",
      "to bear the javelin-wound without springing and biting. And yet—how\r\n",
      "could he tell a woman that he was ready to curse her? He was fuming\r\n",
      "under a repressive law which he was forced to acknowledge: he was\r\n",
      "dangerously poised, and Rosamond’s voice now brought the decisive\r\n",
      "vibration. In flute-like tones of sarcasm she said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can easily go after Mrs. Casaubon and explain your preference.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go after her!” he burst out, with a sharp edge in his voice. “Do you\r\n",
      "think she would turn to look at me, or value any word I ever uttered to\r\n",
      "her again at more than a dirty feather?—Explain! How can a man explain\r\n",
      "at the expense of a woman?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can tell her what you please,” said Rosamond with more tremor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you suppose she would like me better for sacrificing you? She is\r\n",
      "not a woman to be flattered because I made myself despicable—to believe\r\n",
      "that I must be true to her because I was a dastard to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began to move about with the restlessness of a wild animal that sees\r\n",
      "prey but cannot reach it. Presently he burst out again—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I had no hope before—not much—of anything better to come. But I had\r\n",
      "one certainty—that she believed in me. Whatever people had said or done\r\n",
      "about me, she believed in me.—That’s gone! She’ll never again think me\r\n",
      "anything but a paltry pretence—too nice to take heaven except upon\r\n",
      "flattering conditions, and yet selling myself for any devil’s change by\r\n",
      "the sly. She’ll think of me as an incarnate insult to her, from the\r\n",
      "first moment we—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will stopped as if he had found himself grasping something that must\r\n",
      "not be thrown and shattered. He found another vent for his rage by\r\n",
      "snatching up Rosamond’s words again, as if they were reptiles to be\r\n",
      "throttled and flung off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Explain! Tell a man to explain how he dropped into hell! Explain my\r\n",
      "preference! I never had a _preference_ for her, any more than I have a\r\n",
      "preference for breathing. No other woman exists by the side of her. I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond, while these poisoned weapons were being hurled at her, was\r\n",
      "almost losing the sense of her identity, and seemed to be waking into\r\n",

      "repulsion, of reticent self-justification such as she had known under\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s most stormy displeasure: all her sensibility was turned into\r\n",
      "a bewildering novelty of pain; she felt a new terrified recoil under a\r\n",
      "lash never experienced before. What another nature felt in opposition\r\n",
      "to her own was being burnt and bitten into her consciousness. When Will\r\n",
      "had ceased to speak she had become an image of sickened misery: her\r\n",
      "lips were pale, and her eyes had a tearless dismay in them. If it had\r\n",
      "been Tertius who stood opposite to her, that look of misery would have\r\n",
      "been a pang to him, and he would have sunk by her side to comfort her,\r\n",
      "with that strong-armed comfort which she had often held very cheap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let it be forgiven to Will that he had no such movement of pity. He had\r\n",
      "felt no bond beforehand to this woman who had spoiled the ideal\r\n",
      "treasure of his life, and he held himself blameless. He knew that he\r\n",
      "was cruel, but he had no relenting in him yet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After he had done speaking, he still moved about, half in absence of\r\n",
      "mind, and Rosamond sat perfectly still. At length Will, seeming to\r\n",
      "bethink himself, took up his hat, yet stood some moments irresolute. He\r\n",
      "had spoken to her in a way that made a phrase of common politeness\r\n",
      "difficult to utter; and yet, now that he had come to the point of going\r\n",
      "away from her without further speech, he shrank from it as a brutality;\r\n",
      "he felt checked and stultified in his anger. He walked towards the\r\n",
      "mantel-piece and leaned his arm on it, and waited in silence for—he\r\n",
      "hardly knew what. The vindictive fire was still burning in him, and he\r\n",
      "could utter no word of retractation; but it was nevertheless in his\r\n",
      "mind that having come back to this hearth where he had enjoyed a\r\n",
      "caressing friendship he had found calamity seated there—he had had\r\n",
      "suddenly revealed to him a trouble that lay outside the home as well as\r\n",
      "within it. And what seemed a foreboding was pressing upon him as with\r\n",
      "slow pincers:—that his life might come to be enslaved by this helpless\r\n",
      "woman who had thrown herself upon him in the dreary sadness of her\r\n",
      "heart. But he was in gloomy rebellion against the fact that his quick\r\n",
      "apprehensiveness foreshadowed to him, and when his eyes fell on\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s blighted face it seemed to him that he was the more pitiable\r\n",
      "of the two; for pain must enter into its glorified life of memory\r\n",
      "before it can turn into compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so they remained for many minutes, opposite each other, far apart,\r\n",
      "in silence; Will’s face still possessed by a mute rage, and Rosamond’s\r\n",
      "by a mute misery. The poor thing had no force to fling out any passion\r\n",
      "in return; the terrible collapse of the illusion towards which all her\r\n",
      "hope had been strained was a stroke which had too thoroughly shaken\r\n",
      "her: her little world was in ruins, and she felt herself tottering in\r\n",
      "the midst as a lonely bewildered consciousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will wished that she would speak and bring some mitigating shadow\r\n",
      "across his own cruel speech, which seemed to stand staring at them both\r\n",
      "in mockery of any attempt at revived fellowship. But she said nothing,\r\n",
      "and at last with a desperate effort over himself, he asked, “Shall I\r\n",
      "come in and see Lydgate this evening?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the exertion of rising to ring the bell, and she remained helpless\r\n",
      "until the girl, surprised at her long absence, thought for the first\r\n",
      "time of looking for her in all the down-stairs rooms. Rosamond said\r\n",
      "that she had felt suddenly sick and faint, and wanted to be helped\r\n",

      "she felt some content that he was there. He perceived the difference in\r\n",
      "a moment, and seating himself by her put his arm gently under her, and\r\n",
      "bending over her said, “My poor Rosamond! has something agitated you?”\r\n",
      "Clinging to him she fell into hysterical sobbings and cries, and for\r\n",
      "the next hour he did nothing but soothe and tend her. He imagined that\r\n",
      "Dorothea had been to see her, and that all this effect on her nervous\r\n",

      "hardness and coldness and aching weariness to bring her relief from the\r\n",
      "mysterious incorporeal might of her anguish: she lay on the bare floor\r\n",
      "and let the night grow cold around her; while her grand woman’s frame\r\n",
      "was shaken by sobs as if she had been a despairing child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were two images—two living forms that tore her heart in two, as\r\n",
      "if it had been the heart of a mother who seems to see her child divided\r\n",
      "by the sword, and presses one bleeding half to her breast while her\r\n",
      "gaze goes forth in agony towards the half which is carried away by the\r\n",
      "lying woman that has never known the mother’s pang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here, with the nearness of an answering smile, here within the\r\n",
      "vibrating bond of mutual speech, was the bright creature whom she had\r\n",
      "trusted—who had come to her like the spirit of morning visiting the dim\r\n",
      "vault where she sat as the bride of a worn-out life; and now, with a\r\n",
      "full consciousness which had never awakened before, she stretched out\r\n",
      "her arms towards him and cried with bitter cries that their nearness\r\n",
      "was a parting vision: she discovered her passion to herself in the\r\n",
      "unshrinking utterance of despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And there, aloof, yet persistently with her, moving wherever she moved,\r\n",
      "was the Will Ladislaw who was a changed belief exhausted of hope, a\r\n",
      "detected illusion—no, a living man towards whom there could not yet\r\n",
      "struggle any wail of regretful pity, from the midst of scorn and\r\n",
      "indignation and jealous offended pride. The fire of Dorothea’s anger\r\n",
      "was not easily spent, and it flamed out in fitful returns of spurning\r\n",
      "reproach. Why had he come obtruding his life into hers, hers that might\r\n",
      "have been whole enough without him? Why had he brought his cheap regard\r\n",
      "and his lip-born words to her who had nothing paltry to give in\r\n",
      "exchange? He knew that he was deluding her—wished, in the very moment\r\n",
      "of farewell, to make her believe that he gave her the whole price of\r\n",
      "her heart, and knew that he had spent it half before. Why had he not\r\n",
      "stayed among the crowd of whom she asked nothing—but only prayed that\r\n",
      "they might be less contemptible?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she lost energy at last even for her loud-whispered cries and\r\n",
      "moans: she subsided into helpless sobs, and on the cold floor she\r\n",
      "sobbed herself to sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the chill hours of the morning twilight, when all was dim around\r\n",
      "her, she awoke—not with any amazed wondering where she was or what had\r\n",
      "happened, but with the clearest consciousness that she was looking into\r\n",
      "the eyes of sorrow. She rose, and wrapped warm things around her, and\r\n",
      "seated herself in a great chair where she had often watched before. She\r\n",
      "was vigorous enough to have borne that hard night without feeling ill\r\n",
      "in body, beyond some aching and fatigue; but she had waked to a new\r\n",
      "condition: she felt as if her soul had been liberated from its terrible\r\n",
      "conflict; she was no longer wrestling with her grief, but could sit\r\n",
      "down with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her\r\n",
      "thoughts. For now the thoughts came thickly. It was not in Dorothea’s\r\n",
      "nature, for longer than the duration of a paroxysm, to sit in the\r\n",
      "narrow cell of her calamity, in the besotted misery of a consciousness\r\n",
      "that only sees another’s lot as an accident of its own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She began now to live through that yesterday morning deliberately\r\n",
      "again, forcing herself to dwell on every detail and its possible\r\n",
      "meaning. Was she alone in that scene? Was it her event only? She forced\r\n",
      "herself to think of it as bound up with another woman’s life—a woman\r\n",
      "towards whom she had set out with a longing to carry some clearness and\r\n",
      "comfort into her beclouded youth. In her first outleap of jealous\r\n",
      "indignation and disgust, when quitting the hateful room, she had flung\r\n",
      "away all the mercy with which she had undertaken that visit. She had\r\n",
      "enveloped both Will and Rosamond in her burning scorn, and it seemed to\r\n",
      "her as if Rosamond were burned out of her sight forever. But that base\r\n",
      "prompting which makes a women more cruel to a rival than to a faithless\r\n",
      "lover, could have no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when the\r\n",
      "dominant spirit of justice within her had once overcome the tumult and\r\n",
      "had once shown her the truer measure of things. All the active thought\r\n",
      "with which she had before been representing to herself the trials of\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s lot, and this young marriage union which, like her own,\r\n",
      "seemed to have its hidden as well as evident troubles—all this vivid\r\n",
      "sympathetic experience returned to her now as a power: it asserted\r\n",
      "itself as acquired knowledge asserts itself and will not let us see as\r\n",
      "we saw in the day of our ignorance. She said to her own irremediable\r\n",
      "grief, that it should make her more helpful, instead of driving her\r\n",
      "back from effort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And what sort of crisis might not this be in three lives whose contact\r\n",
      "with hers laid an obligation on her as if they had been suppliants\r\n",
      "bearing the sacred branch? The objects of her rescue were not to be\r\n",
      "sought out by her fancy: they were chosen for her. She yearned towards\r\n",
      "the perfect Right, that it might make a throne within her, and rule her\r\n",
      "errant will. “What should I do—how should I act now, this very day, if\r\n",
      "I could clutch my own pain, and compel it to silence, and think of\r\n",
      "those three?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had taken long for her to come to that question, and there was light\r\n",
      "piercing into the room. She opened her curtains, and looked out towards\r\n",
      "the bit of road that lay in view, with fields beyond outside the\r\n",
      "entrance-gates. On the road there was a man with a bundle on his back\r\n",
      "and a woman carrying her baby; in the field she could see figures\r\n",
      "moving—perhaps the shepherd with his dog. Far off in the bending sky\r\n",
      "was the pearly light; and she felt the largeness of the world and the\r\n",
      "manifold wakings of men to labor and endurance. She was a part of that\r\n",
      "involuntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from\r\n",
      "her luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish\r\n",
      "complaining.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What she would resolve to do that day did not yet seem quite clear, but\r\n",
      "something that she could achieve stirred her as with an approaching\r\n",
      "murmur which would soon gather distinctness. She took off the clothes\r\n",
      "which seemed to have some of the weariness of a hard watching in them,\r\n",
      "and began to make her toilet. Presently she rang for Tantripp, who came\r\n",
      "in her dressing-gown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, madam, you’ve never been in bed this blessed night,” burst out\r\n",
      "Tantripp, looking first at the bed and then at Dorothea’s face, which\r\n",
      "in spite of bathing had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a mater\r\n",
      "dolorosa. “You’ll kill yourself, you _will_. Anybody might think now\r\n",
      "you had a right to give yourself a little comfort.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be alarmed, Tantripp,” said Dorothea, smiling. “I have slept; I\r\n",
      "am not ill. I shall be glad of a cup of coffee as soon as possible. And\r\n",
      "I want you to bring me my new dress; and most likely I shall want my\r\n",
      "new bonnet to-day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They’ve lain there a month and more ready for you, madam, and most\r\n",
      "thankful I shall be to see you with a couple o’ pounds’ worth less of\r\n",
      "crape,” said Tantripp, stooping to light the fire. “There’s a reason in\r\n",
      "mourning, as I’ve always said; and three folds at the bottom of your\r\n",
      "skirt and a plain quilling in your bonnet—and if ever anybody looked\r\n",
      "like an angel, it’s you in a net quilling—is what’s consistent for a\r\n",
      "second year. At least, that’s _my_ thinking,” ended Tantripp, looking\r\n",
      "anxiously at the fire; “and if anybody was to marry me flattering\r\n",
      "himself I should wear those hijeous weepers two years for him, he’d be\r\n",
      "deceived by his own vanity, that’s all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The fire will do, my good Tan,” said Dorothea, speaking as she used to\r\n",
      "do in the old Lausanne days, only with a very low voice; “get me the\r\n",
      "coffee.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She folded herself in the large chair, and leaned her head against it\r\n",
      "in fatigued quiescence, while Tantripp went away wondering at this\r\n",
      "strange contrariness in her young mistress—that just the morning when\r\n",
      "she had more of a widow’s face than ever, she should have asked for her\r\n",
      "lighter mourning which she had waived before. Tantripp would never have\r\n",
      "found the clew to this mystery. Dorothea wished to acknowledge that she\r\n",
      "had not the less an active life before her because she had buried a\r\n",
      "private joy; and the tradition that fresh garments belonged to all\r\n",
      "initiation, haunting her mind, made her grasp after even that slight\r\n",
      "outward help towards calm resolve. For the resolve was not easy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless at eleven o’clock she was walking towards Middlemarch,\r\n",
      "having made up her mind that she would make as quietly and unnoticeably\r\n",
      "as possible her second attempt to see and save Rosamond.\r\n",

      "voice, and immediately came to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you think that Mrs. Lydgate can receive me this morning?” she said,\r\n",

      "will be kind enough to come in and let me tell her that you are here.\r\n",
      "She has not been very well since you were here yesterday, but she is\r\n",
      "better this morning, and I think it is very likely that she will be\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was plain that Lydgate, as Dorothea had expected, knew nothing about\r\n",
      "the circumstances of her yesterday’s visit; nay, he appeared to imagine\r\n",
      "that she had carried it out according to her intention. She had\r\n",
      "prepared a little note asking Rosamond to see her, which she would have\r\n",
      "given to the servant if he had not been in the way, but now she was in\r\n",
      "much anxiety as to the result of his announcement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After leading her into the drawing-room, he paused to take a letter\r\n",
      "from his pocket and put it into her hands, saying, “I wrote this last\r\n",
      "night, and was going to carry it to Lowick in my ride. When one is\r\n",
      "grateful for something too good for common thanks, writing is less\r\n",
      "unsatisfactory than speech—one does not at least _hear_ how inadequate\r\n",
      "the words are.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s face brightened. “It is I who have most to thank for, since\r\n",
      "you have let me take that place. You _have_ consented?” she said,\r\n",
      "suddenly doubting.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He said no more, but went up-stairs to Rosamond, who had but lately\r\n",
      "finished dressing herself, and sat languidly wondering what she should\r\n",
      "do next, her habitual industry in small things, even in the days of her\r\n",
      "sadness, prompting her to begin some kind of occupation, which she\r\n",
      "dragged through slowly or paused in from lack of interest. She looked\r\n",
      "ill, but had recovered her usual quietude of manner, and Lydgate had\r\n",
      "feared to disturb her by any questions. He had told her of Dorothea’s\r\n",
      "letter containing the check, and afterwards he had said, “Ladislaw is\r\n",
      "come, Rosy; he sat with me last night; I dare say he will be here again\r\n",
      "to-day. I thought he looked rather battered and depressed.” And\r\n",
      "Rosamond had made no reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, when he came up, he said to her very gently, “Rosy, dear, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Casaubon is come to see you again; you would like to see her, would you\r\n",
      "not?” That she colored and gave rather a startled movement did not\r\n",
      "surprise him after the agitation produced by the interview yesterday—a\r\n",
      "beneficent agitation, he thought, since it seemed to have made her turn\r\n",
      "to him again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond dared not say no. She dared not with a tone of her voice touch\r\n",
      "the facts of yesterday. Why had Mrs. Casaubon come again? The answer\r\n",
      "was a blank which Rosamond could only fill up with dread, for Will\r\n",
      "Ladislaw’s lacerating words had made every thought of Dorothea a fresh\r\n",
      "smart to her. Nevertheless, in her new humiliating uncertainty she\r\n",
      "dared do nothing but comply. She did not say yes, but she rose and let\r\n",
      "Lydgate put a light shawl over her shoulders, while he said, “I am\r\n",
      "going out immediately.” Then something crossed her mind which prompted\r\n",
      "her to say, “Pray tell Martha not to bring any one else into the\r\n",
      "drawing-room.” And Lydgate assented, thinking that he fully understood\r\n",
      "this wish. He led her down to the drawing-room door, and then turned\r\n",
      "away, observing to himself that he was rather a blundering husband to\r\n",
      "be dependent for his wife’s trust in him on the influence of another\r\n",
      "woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond, wrapping her soft shawl around her as she walked towards\r\n",
      "Dorothea, was inwardly wrapping her soul in cold reserve. Had Mrs.\r\n",
      "Casaubon come to say anything to her about Will? If so, it was a\r\n",
      "liberty that Rosamond resented; and she prepared herself to meet every\r\n",
      "word with polite impassibility. Will had bruised her pride too sorely\r\n",
      "for her to feel any compunction towards him and Dorothea: her own\r\n",
      "injury seemed much the greater. Dorothea was not only the “preferred”\r\n",
      "woman, but had also a formidable advantage in being Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "benefactor; and to poor Rosamond’s pained confused vision it seemed\r\n",
      "that this Mrs. Casaubon—this woman who predominated in all things\r\n",
      "concerning her—must have come now with the sense of having the\r\n",
      "advantage, and with animosity prompting her to use it. Indeed, not\r\n",
      "Rosamond only, but any one else, knowing the outer facts of the case,\r\n",
      "and not the simple inspiration on which Dorothea acted, might well have\r\n",
      "wondered why she came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Looking like the lovely ghost of herself, her graceful slimness wrapped\r\n",
      "in her soft white shawl, the rounded infantine mouth and cheek\r\n",
      "inevitably suggesting mildness and innocence, Rosamond paused at three\r\n",
      "yards’ distance from her visitor and bowed. But Dorothea, who had taken\r\n",
      "off her gloves, from an impulse which she could never resist when she\r\n",
      "wanted a sense of freedom, came forward, and with her face full of a\r\n",
      "sad yet sweet openness, put out her hand. Rosamond could not avoid\r\n",
      "meeting her glance, could not avoid putting her small hand into\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s, which clasped it with gentle motherliness; and immediately\r\n",
      "a doubt of her own prepossessions began to stir within her. Rosamond’s\r\n",
      "eye was quick for faces; she saw that Mrs. Casaubon’s face looked pale\r\n",
      "and changed since yesterday, yet gentle, and like the firm softness of\r\n",
      "her hand. But Dorothea had counted a little too much on her own\r\n",
      "strength: the clearness and intensity of her mental action this morning\r\n",
      "were the continuance of a nervous exaltation which made her frame as\r\n",
      "dangerously responsive as a bit of finest Venetian crystal; and in\r\n",
      "looking at Rosamond, she suddenly found her heart swelling, and was\r\n",
      "unable to speak—all her effort was required to keep back tears. She\r\n",
      "succeeded in that, and the emotion only passed over her face like the\r\n",
      "spirit of a sob; but it added to Rosamond’s impression that Mrs.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s state of mind must be something quite different from what\r\n",
      "she had imagined.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they sat down without a word of preface on the two chairs that\r\n",
      "happened to be nearest, and happened also to be close together; though\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s notion when she first bowed was that she should stay a long\r\n",
      "way off from Mrs. Casaubon. But she ceased thinking how anything would\r\n",
      "turn out—merely wondering what would come. And Dorothea began to speak\r\n",
      "quite simply, gathering firmness as she went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I had an errand yesterday which I did not finish; that is why I am\r\n",
      "here again so soon. You will not think me too troublesome when I tell\r\n",
      "you that I came to talk to you about the injustice that has been shown\r\n",
      "towards Mr. Lydgate. It will cheer you—will it not?—to know a great\r\n",
      "deal about him, that he may not like to speak about himself just\r\n",
      "because it is in his own vindication and to his own honor. You will\r\n",
      "like to know that your husband has warm friends, who have not left off\r\n",
      "believing in his high character? You will let me speak of this without\r\n",
      "thinking that I take a liberty?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cordial, pleading tones which seemed to flow with generous\r\n",
      "heedlessness above all the facts which had filled Rosamond’s mind as\r\n",
      "grounds of obstruction and hatred between her and this woman, came as\r\n",
      "soothingly as a warm stream over her shrinking fears. Of course Mrs.\r\n",
      "Casaubon had the facts in her mind, but she was not going to speak of\r\n",
      "anything connected with them. That relief was too great for Rosamond to\r\n",
      "feel much else at the moment. She answered prettily, in the new ease of\r\n",
      "her soul—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know you have been very good. I shall like to hear anything you will\r\n",
      "say to me about Tertius.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The day before yesterday,” said Dorothea, “when I had asked him to\r\n",
      "come to Lowick to give me his opinion on the affairs of the Hospital,\r\n",
      "he told me everything about his conduct and feelings in this sad event\r\n",
      "which has made ignorant people cast suspicions on him. The reason he\r\n",
      "told me was because I was very bold and asked him. I believed that he\r\n",
      "had never acted dishonorably, and I begged him to tell me the history.\r\n",
      "He confessed to me that he had never told it before, not even to you,\r\n",
      "because he had a great dislike to say, ‘I was not wrong,’ as if that\r\n",
      "were proof, when there are guilty people who will say so. The truth is,\r\n",
      "he knew nothing of this man Raffles, or that there were any bad secrets\r\n",
      "about him; and he thought that Mr. Bulstrode offered him the money\r\n",
      "because he repented, out of kindness, of having refused it before. All\r\n",
      "his anxiety about his patient was to treat him rightly, and he was a\r\n",
      "little uncomfortable that the case did not end as he had expected; but\r\n",
      "he thought then and still thinks that there may have been no wrong in\r\n",
      "it on any one’s part. And I have told Mr. Farebrother, and Mr. Brooke,\r\n",
      "and Sir James Chettam: they all believe in your husband. That will\r\n",
      "cheer you, will it not? That will give you courage?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s face had become animated, and as it beamed on Rosamond very\r\n",
      "close to her, she felt something like bashful timidity before a\r\n",
      "superior, in the presence of this self-forgetful ardor. She said, with\r\n",
      "blushing embarrassment, “Thank you: you are very kind.”\r\n",

      "large white hand to obey her, and felt thankful for this little mark of\r\n",

      "her night’s anguish, had not taken that walk to Rosamond—why, she\r\n",
      "perhaps would have been a woman who gained a higher character for\r\n",
      "discretion, but it would certainly not have been as well for those\r\n",
      "three who were on one hearth in Lydgate’s house at half-past seven that\r\n",
      "evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond had been prepared for Will’s visit, and she received him with\r\n",
      "a languid coldness which Lydgate accounted for by her nervous\r\n",
      "exhaustion, of which he could not suppose that it had any relation to\r\n",
      "Will. And when she sat in silence bending over a bit of work, he\r\n",
      "innocently apologized for her in an indirect way by begging her to lean\r\n",
      "backward and rest. Will was miserable in the necessity for playing the\r\n",
      "part of a friend who was making his first appearance and greeting to\r\n",
      "Rosamond, while his thoughts were busy about her feeling since that\r\n",
      "scene of yesterday, which seemed still inexorably to enclose them both,\r\n",
      "like the painful vision of a double madness. It happened that nothing\r\n",
      "called Lydgate out of the room; but when Rosamond poured out the tea,\r\n",
      "and Will came near to fetch it, she placed a tiny bit of folded paper\r\n",
      "in his saucer. He saw it and secured it quickly, but as he went back to\r\n",
      "his inn he had no eagerness to unfold the paper. What Rosamond had\r\n",
      "written to him would probably deepen the painful impressions of the\r\n",
      "evening. Still, he opened and read it by his bed-candle. There were\r\n",
      "only these few words in her neatly flowing hand:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have told Mrs. Casaubon. She is not under any mistake about you. I\r\n",
      "told her because she came to see me and was very kind. You will have\r\n",
      "nothing to reproach me with now. I shall not have made any difference\r\n",
      "to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect of these words was not quite all gladness. As Will dwelt on\r\n",
      "them with excited imagination, he felt his cheeks and ears burning at\r\n",
      "the thought of what had occurred between Dorothea and Rosamond—at the\r\n",
      "uncertainty how far Dorothea might still feel her dignity wounded in\r\n",
      "having an explanation of his conduct offered to her. There might still\r\n",
      "remain in her mind a changed association with him which made an\r\n",
      "irremediable difference—a lasting flaw. With active fancy he wrought\r\n",
      "himself into a state of doubt little more easy than that of the man who\r\n",
      "has escaped from wreck by night and stands on unknown ground in the\r\n",
      "darkness. Until that wretched yesterday—except the moment of vexation\r\n",
      "long ago in the very same room and in the very same presence—all their\r\n",
      "vision, all their thought of each other, had been as in a world apart,\r\n",
      "where the sunshine fell on tall white lilies, where no evil lurked, and\r\n",

      "On the second morning after Dorothea’s visit to Rosamond, she had had\r\n",
      "two nights of sound sleep, and had not only lost all traces of fatigue,\r\n",
      "but felt as if she had a great deal of superfluous strength—that is to\r\n",
      "say, more strength than she could manage to concentrate on any\r\n",
      "occupation. The day before, she had taken long walks outside the\r\n",

      "life told any one the reason why she spent her time in that fruitless\r\n",
      "manner, and this morning she was rather angry with herself for her\r\n",
      "childish restlessness. To-day was to be spent quite differently. What\r\n",
      "was there to be done in the village? Oh dear! nothing. Everybody was\r\n",
      "well and had flannel; nobody’s pig had died; and it was Saturday\r\n",
      "morning, when there was a general scrubbing of doors and door-stones,\r\n",
      "and when it was useless to go into the school. But there were various\r\n",
      "subjects that Dorothea was trying to get clear upon, and she resolved\r\n",
      "to throw herself energetically into the gravest of all. She sat down in\r\n",
      "the library before her particular little heap of books on political\r\n",
      "economy and kindred matters, out of which she was trying to get light\r\n",
      "as to the best way of spending money so as not to injure one’s\r\n",
      "neighbors, or—what comes to the same thing—so as to do them the most\r\n",
      "good. Here was a weighty subject which, if she could but lay hold of\r\n",
      "it, would certainly keep her mind steady. Unhappily her mind slipped\r\n",
      "off it for a whole hour; and at the end she found herself reading\r\n",
      "sentences twice over with an intense consciousness of many things, but\r\n",
      "not of any one thing contained in the text. This was hopeless. Should\r\n",
      "she order the carriage and drive to Tipton? No; for some reason or\r\n",
      "other she preferred staying at Lowick. But her vagrant mind must be\r\n",
      "reduced to order: there was an art in self-discipline; and she walked\r\n",
      "round and round the brown library considering by what sort of manoeuvre\r\n",
      "she could arrest her wandering thoughts. Perhaps a mere task was the\r\n",
      "best means—something to which she must go doggedly. Was there not the\r\n",
      "geography of Asia Minor, in which her slackness had often been rebuked\r\n",
      "by Mr. Casaubon? She went to the cabinet of maps and unrolled one: this\r\n",
      "morning she might make herself finally sure that Paphlagonia was not on\r\n",
      "the Levantine coast, and fix her total darkness about the Chalybes\r\n",
      "firmly on the shores of the Euxine. A map was a fine thing to study\r\n",
      "when you were disposed to think of something else, being made up of\r\n",
      "names that would turn into a chime if you went back upon them. Dorothea\r\n",
      "set earnestly to work, bending close to her map, and uttering the names\r\n",
      "in an audible, subdued tone, which often got into a chime. She looked\r\n",
      "amusingly girlish after all her deep experience—nodding her head and\r\n",
      "marking the names off on her fingers, with a little pursing of her lip,\r\n",
      "and now and then breaking off to put her hands on each side of her face\r\n",
      "and say, “Oh dear! oh dear!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no reason why this should end any more than a merry-go-round;\r\n",

      "announcement of Miss Noble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little old lady, whose bonnet hardly reached Dorothea’s shoulder,\r\n",
      "was warmly welcomed, but while her hand was being pressed she made many\r\n",
      "of her beaver-like noises, as if she had something difficult to say.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do sit down,” said Dorothea, rolling a chair forward. “Am I wanted for\r\n",
      "anything? I shall be so glad if I can do anything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will not stay,” said Miss Noble, putting her hand into her small\r\n",
      "basket, and holding some article inside it nervously; “I have left a\r\n",
      "friend in the churchyard.” She lapsed into her inarticulate sounds, and\r\n",
      "unconsciously drew forth the article which she was fingering. It was\r\n",
      "the tortoise-shell lozenge-box, and Dorothea felt the color mounting to\r\n",
      "her cheeks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Ladislaw,” continued the timid little woman. “He fears he has\r\n",
      "offended you, and has begged me to ask if you will see him for a few\r\n",
      "minutes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea did not answer on the instant: it was crossing her mind that\r\n",
      "she could not receive him in this library, where her husband’s\r\n",
      "prohibition seemed to dwell. She looked towards the window. Could she\r\n",
      "go out and meet him in the grounds? The sky was heavy, and the trees\r\n",
      "had begun to shiver as at a coming storm. Besides, she shrank from\r\n",
      "going out to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do see him, Mrs. Casaubon,” said Miss Noble, pathetically; “else I\r\n",
      "must go back and say No, and that will hurt him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I will see him,” said Dorothea. “Pray tell him to come.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What else was there to be done? There was nothing that she longed for\r\n",
      "at that moment except to see Will: the possibility of seeing him had\r\n",
      "thrust itself insistently between her and every other object; and yet\r\n",
      "she had a throbbing excitement like an alarm upon her—a sense that she\r\n",
      "was doing something daringly defiant for his sake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the little lady had trotted away on her mission, Dorothea stood in\r\n",
      "the middle of the library with her hands falling clasped before her,\r\n",
      "making no attempt to compose herself in an attitude of dignified\r\n",
      "unconsciousness. What she was least conscious of just then was her own\r\n",
      "body: she was thinking of what was likely to be in Will’s mind, and of\r\n",
      "the hard feelings that others had had about him. How could any duty\r\n",
      "bind her to hardness? Resistance to unjust dispraise had mingled with\r\n",
      "her feeling for him from the very first, and now in the rebound of her\r\n",
      "heart after her anguish the resistance was stronger than ever. “If I\r\n",
      "love him too much it is because he has been used so ill:”—there was a\r\n",
      "voice within her saying this to some imagined audience in the library,\r\n",
      "when the door was opened, and she saw Will before her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She did not move, and he came towards her with more doubt and timidity\r\n",
      "in his face than she had ever seen before. He was in a state of\r\n",
      "uncertainty which made him afraid lest some look or word of his should\r\n",
      "condemn him to a new distance from her; and Dorothea was afraid of her\r\n",
      "_own_ emotion. She looked as if there were a spell upon her, keeping\r\n",
      "her motionless and hindering her from unclasping her hands, while some\r\n",
      "intense, grave yearning was imprisoned within her eyes. Seeing that she\r\n",
      "did not put out her hand as usual, Will paused a yard from her and said\r\n",
      "with embarrassment, “I am so grateful to you for seeing me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wanted to see you,” said Dorothea, having no other words at command.\r\n",
      "It did not occur to her to sit down, and Will did not give a cheerful\r\n",
      "interpretation to this queenly way of receiving him; but he went on to\r\n",
      "say what he had made up his mind to say.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I fear you think me foolish and perhaps wrong for coming back so soon.\r\n",
      "I have been punished for my impatience. You know—every one knows now—a\r\n",
      "painful story about my parentage. I knew of it before I went away, and\r\n",
      "I always meant to tell you of it if—if we ever met again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a slight movement in Dorothea, and she unclasped her hands,\r\n",
      "but immediately folded them over each other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But the affair is matter of gossip now,” Will continued. “I wished you\r\n",
      "to know that something connected with it—something which happened\r\n",
      "before I went away, helped to bring me down here again. At least I\r\n",
      "thought it excused my coming. It was the idea of getting Bulstrode to\r\n",
      "apply some money to a public purpose—some money which he had thought of\r\n",
      "giving me. Perhaps it is rather to Bulstrode’s credit that he privately\r\n",
      "offered me compensation for an old injury: he offered to give me a good\r\n",
      "income to make amends; but I suppose you know the disagreeable story?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will looked doubtfully at Dorothea, but his manner was gathering some\r\n",
      "of the defiant courage with which he always thought of this fact in his\r\n",
      "destiny. He added, “You know that it must be altogether painful to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes—yes—I know,” said Dorothea, hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not choose to accept an income from such a source. I was sure\r\n",
      "that you would not think well of me if I did so,” said Will. Why should\r\n",
      "he mind saying anything of that sort to her now? She knew that he had\r\n",
      "avowed his love for her. “I felt that”—he broke off, nevertheless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You acted as I should have expected you to act,” said Dorothea, her\r\n",
      "face brightening and her head becoming a little more erect on its\r\n",
      "beautiful stem.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not believe that you would let any circumstance of my birth\r\n",
      "create a prejudice in you against me, though it was sure to do so in\r\n",
      "others,” said Will, shaking his head backward in his old way, and\r\n",
      "looking with a grave appeal into her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If it were a new hardship it would be a new reason for me to cling to\r\n",
      "you,” said Dorothea, fervidly. “Nothing could have changed me but—” her\r\n",
      "heart was swelling, and it was difficult to go on; she made a great\r\n",
      "effort over herself to say in a low tremulous voice, “but thinking that\r\n",
      "you were different—not so good as I had believed you to be.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are sure to believe me better than I am in everything but one,”\r\n",
      "said Will, giving way to his own feeling in the evidence of hers. “I\r\n",
      "mean, in my truth to you. When I thought you doubted of that, I didn’t\r\n",
      "care about anything that was left. I thought it was all over with me,\r\n",
      "and there was nothing to try for—only things to endure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t doubt you any longer,” said Dorothea, putting out her hand; a\r\n",
      "vague fear for him impelling her unutterable affection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took her hand and raised it to his lips with something like a sob.\r\n",
      "But he stood with his hat and gloves in the other hand, and might have\r\n",
      "done for the portrait of a Royalist. Still it was difficult to loose\r\n",
      "the hand, and Dorothea, withdrawing it in a confusion that distressed\r\n",
      "her, looked and moved away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“See how dark the clouds have become, and how the trees are tossed,”\r\n",
      "she said, walking towards the window, yet speaking and moving with only\r\n",
      "a dim sense of what she was doing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will followed her at a little distance, and leaned against the tall\r\n",
      "back of a leather chair, on which he ventured now to lay his hat and\r\n",
      "gloves, and free himself from the intolerable durance of formality to\r\n",
      "which he had been for the first time condemned in Dorothea’s presence.\r\n",
      "It must be confessed that he felt very happy at that moment leaning on\r\n",
      "the chair. He was not much afraid of anything that she might feel now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They stood silent, not looking at each other, but looking at the\r\n",
      "evergreens which were being tossed, and were showing the pale underside\r\n",
      "of their leaves against the blackening sky. Will never enjoyed the\r\n",
      "prospect of a storm so much: it delivered him from the necessity of\r\n",
      "going away. Leaves and little branches were hurled about, and the\r\n",
      "thunder was getting nearer. The light was more and more sombre, but\r\n",
      "there came a flash of lightning which made them start and look at each\r\n",
      "other, and then smile. Dorothea began to say what she had been thinking\r\n",
      "of.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was a wrong thing for you to say, that you would have had nothing\r\n",
      "to try for. If we had lost our own chief good, other people’s good\r\n",
      "would remain, and that is worth trying for. Some can be happy. I seemed\r\n",
      "to see that more clearly than ever, when I was the most wretched. I can\r\n",
      "hardly think how I could have borne the trouble, if that feeling had\r\n",
      "not come to me to make strength.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have never felt the sort of misery I felt,” said Will; “the misery\r\n",
      "of knowing that you must despise me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I have felt worse—it was worse to think ill—” Dorothea had begun\r\n",
      "impetuously, but broke off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will colored. He had the sense that whatever she said was uttered in\r\n",
      "the vision of a fatality that kept them apart. He was silent a moment,\r\n",
      "and then said passionately—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We may at least have the comfort of speaking to each other without\r\n",
      "disguise. Since I must go away—since we must always be divided—you may\r\n",
      "think of me as one on the brink of the grave.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While he was speaking there came a vivid flash of lightning which lit\r\n",
      "each of them up for the other—and the light seemed to be the terror of\r\n",
      "a hopeless love. Dorothea darted instantaneously from the window; Will\r\n",
      "followed her, seizing her hand with a spasmodic movement; and so they\r\n",
      "stood, with their hands clasped, like two children, looking out on the\r\n",
      "storm, while the thunder gave a tremendous crack and roll above them,\r\n",
      "and the rain began to pour down. Then they turned their faces towards\r\n",
      "each other, with the memory of his last words in them, and they did not\r\n",
      "loose each other’s hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is no hope for me,” said Will. “Even if you loved me as well as\r\n",
      "I love you—even if I were everything to you—I shall most likely always\r\n",
      "be very poor: on a sober calculation, one can count on nothing but a\r\n",
      "creeping lot. It is impossible for us ever to belong to each other. It\r\n",
      "is perhaps base of me to have asked for a word from you. I meant to go\r\n",
      "away into silence, but I have not been able to do what I meant.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be sorry,” said Dorothea, in her clear tender tones. “I would\r\n",
      "rather share all the trouble of our parting.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her lips trembled, and so did his. It was never known which lips were\r\n",
      "the first to move towards the other lips; but they kissed tremblingly,\r\n",
      "and then they moved apart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rain was dashing against the window-panes as if an angry spirit\r\n",
      "were within it, and behind it was the great swoop of the wind; it was\r\n",
      "one of those moments in which both the busy and the idle pause with a\r\n",
      "certain awe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea sat down on the seat nearest to her, a long low ottoman in the\r\n",
      "middle of the room, and with her hands folded over each other on her\r\n",
      "lap, looked at the drear outer world. Will stood still an instant\r\n",
      "looking at her, then seated himself beside her, and laid his hand on\r\n",
      "hers, which turned itself upward to be clasped. They sat in that way\r\n",
      "without looking at each other, until the rain abated and began to fall\r\n",
      "in stillness. Each had been full of thoughts which neither of them\r\n",
      "could begin to utter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when the rain was quiet, Dorothea turned to look at Will. With\r\n",
      "passionate exclamation, as if some torture screw were threatening him,\r\n",
      "he started up and said, “It is impossible!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went and leaned on the back of the chair again, and seemed to be\r\n",
      "battling with his own anger, while she looked towards him sadly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is as fatal as a murder or any other horror that divides people,”\r\n",
      "he burst out again; “it is more intolerable—to have our life maimed by\r\n",
      "petty accidents.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No—don’t say that—your life need not be maimed,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "gently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, it must,” said Will, angrily. “It is cruel of you to speak in\r\n",
      "that way—as if there were any comfort. You may see beyond the misery of\r\n",
      "it, but I don’t. It is unkind—it is throwing back my love for you as if\r\n",
      "it were a trifle, to speak in that way in the face of the fact. We can\r\n",
      "never be married.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some time—we might,” said Dorothea, in a trembling voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When?” said Will, bitterly. “What is the use of counting on any\r\n",

      "easier. At last he turned, still resting against the chair, and\r\n",

      "Arthur, who was being drawn in his chariot, and, as became the\r\n",
      "infantine Bouddha, was sheltered by his sacred umbrella with handsome\r\n",
      "silken fringe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ladies also talked politics, though more fitfully. Mrs. Cadwallader\r\n",
      "was strong on the intended creation of peers: she had it for certain\r\n",
      "from her cousin that Truberry had gone over to the other side entirely\r\n",
      "at the instigation of his wife, who had scented peerages in the air\r\n",
      "from the very first introduction of the Reform question, and would sign\r\n",
      "her soul away to take precedence of her younger sister, who had married\r\n",

      "reprehensible, and remembered that Mrs. Truberry’s mother was a Miss\r\n",
      "Walsingham of Melspring. Celia confessed it was nicer to be “Lady” than\r\n",

      "melancholy “Well, my dear!” As they approached, it was evident that Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke was looking dejected, but this was fully accounted for by the\r\n",
      "state of politics; and as he was shaking hands all round without more\r\n",
      "greeting than a “Well, you’re all here, you know,” the Rector said,\r\n",

      "“Gamekeeper? No. Let us go in; I can tell you all in the house, you\r\n",

      "included them in his confidence. “As to poachers like Trapping Bass,\r\n",
      "you know, Chettam,” he continued, as they were entering, “when you are\r\n",
      "a magistrate, you’ll not find it so easy to commit. Severity is all\r\n",
      "very well, but it’s a great deal easier when you’ve got somebody to do\r\n",
      "it for you. You have a soft place in your heart yourself, you\r\n",

      "among a number of disjointed particulars, as if it were a medicine that\r\n",
      "would get a milder flavor by mixing. He continued his chat with Sir\r\n",
      "James about the poachers until they were all seated, and Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader, impatient of this drivelling, said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "settled. What is it, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it’s a very trying thing, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “I’m glad\r\n",
      "you and the Rector are here; it’s a family matter—but you will help us\r\n",
      "all to bear it, Cadwallader. I’ve got to break it to you, my dear.”\r\n",

      "singular in things: they come round, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must be about Dodo,” said Celia, who had been used to think of her\r\n",
      "sister as the dangerous part of the family machinery. She had seated\r\n",
      "herself on a low stool against her husband’s knee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For God’s sake let us hear what it is!” said Sir James.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you know, Chettam, I couldn’t help Casaubon’s will: it was a\r\n",
      "sort of will to make things worse.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Exactly,” said Sir James, hastily. “But _what_ is worse?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea is going to be married again, you know,” said Mr. Brooke,\r\n",
      "nodding towards Celia, who immediately looked up at her husband with a\r\n",
      "frightened glance, and put her hand on his knee. Sir James was almost\r\n",
      "white with anger, but he did not speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Merciful heaven!” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Not to _young_ Ladislaw?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke nodded, saying, “Yes; to Ladislaw,” and then fell into a\r\n",
      "prudential silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see, Humphrey!” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her arm towards her\r\n",
      "husband. “Another time you will admit that I have some foresight; or\r\n",
      "rather you will contradict me and be just as blind as ever. _You_\r\n",
      "supposed that the young gentleman was gone out of the country.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So he might be, and yet come back,” said the Rector, quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When did you learn this?” said Sir James, not liking to hear any one\r\n",
      "else speak, though finding it difficult to speak himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yesterday,” said Mr. Brooke, meekly. “I went to Lowick. Dorothea sent\r\n",
      "for me, you know. It had come about quite suddenly—neither of them had\r\n",
      "any idea two days ago—not any idea, you know. There’s something\r\n",
      "singular in things. But Dorothea is quite determined—it is no use\r\n",
      "opposing. I put it strongly to her. I did my duty, Chettam. But she can\r\n",
      "act as she likes, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would have been better if I had called him out and shot him a year\r\n",
      "ago,” said Sir James, not from bloody-mindedness, but because he needed\r\n",
      "something strong to say.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Really, James, that would have been very disagreeable,” said Celia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be reasonable, Chettam. Look at the affair more quietly,” said Mr.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader, sorry to see his good-natured friend so overmastered by\r\n",
      "anger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is not so very easy for a man of any dignity—with any sense of\r\n",
      "right—when the affair happens to be in his own family,” said Sir James,\r\n",
      "still in his white indignation. “It is perfectly scandalous. If\r\n",
      "Ladislaw had had a spark of honor he would have gone out of the country\r\n",
      "at once, and never shown his face in it again. However, I am not\r\n",
      "surprised. The day after Casaubon’s funeral I said what ought to be\r\n",
      "done. But I was not listened to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You wanted what was impossible, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke.\r\n",
      "“You wanted him shipped off. I told you Ladislaw was not to be done as\r\n",
      "we liked with: he had his ideas. He was a remarkable fellow—I always\r\n",
      "said he was a remarkable fellow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Sir James, unable to repress a retort, “it is rather a pity\r\n",
      "you formed that high opinion of him. We are indebted to that for his\r\n",
      "being lodged in this neighborhood. We are indebted to that for seeing a\r\n",
      "woman like Dorothea degrading herself by marrying him.” Sir James made\r\n",
      "little stoppages between his clauses, the words not coming easily. “A\r\n",
      "man so marked out by her husband’s will, that delicacy ought to have\r\n",
      "forbidden her from seeing him again—who takes her out of her proper\r\n",
      "rank—into poverty—has the meanness to accept such a sacrifice—has\r\n",
      "always had an objectionable position—a bad origin—and, _I believe_, is\r\n",
      "a man of little principle and light character. That is my opinion.” Sir\r\n",
      "James ended emphatically, turning aside and crossing his leg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I pointed everything out to her,” said Mr. Brooke, apologetically—“I\r\n",
      "mean the poverty, and abandoning her position. I said, ‘My dear, you\r\n",
      "don’t know what it is to live on seven hundred a-year, and have no\r\n",
      "carriage, and that kind of thing, and go amongst people who don’t know\r\n",
      "who you are.’ I put it strongly to her. But I advise you to talk to\r\n",
      "Dorothea herself. The fact is, she has a dislike to Casaubon’s\r\n",
      "property. You will hear what she says, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No—excuse me—I shall not,” said Sir James, with more coolness. “I\r\n",
      "cannot bear to see her again; it is too painful. It hurts me too much\r\n",
      "that a woman like Dorothea should have done what is wrong.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be just, Chettam,” said the easy, large-lipped Rector, who objected to\r\n",
      "all this unnecessary discomfort. “Mrs. Casaubon may be acting\r\n",
      "imprudently: she is giving up a fortune for the sake of a man, and we\r\n",
      "men have so poor an opinion of each other that we can hardly call a\r\n",
      "woman wise who does that. But I think you should not condemn it as a\r\n",
      "wrong action, in the strict sense of the word.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I do,” answered Sir James. “I think that Dorothea commits a wrong\r\n",
      "action in marrying Ladislaw.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear fellow, we are rather apt to consider an act wrong because it\r\n",
      "is unpleasant to us,” said the Rector, quietly. Like many men who take\r\n",
      "life easily, he had the knack of saying a home truth occasionally to\r\n",
      "those who felt themselves virtuously out of temper. Sir James took out\r\n",
      "his handkerchief and began to bite the corner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is very dreadful of Dodo, though,” said Celia, wishing to justify\r\n",
      "her husband. “She said she _never would_ marry again—not anybody at\r\n",
      "all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I heard her say the same thing myself,” said Lady Chettam,\r\n",
      "majestically, as if this were royal evidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, there is usually a silent exception in such cases,” said Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader. “The only wonder to me is, that any of you are surprised.\r\n",
      "You did nothing to hinder it. If you would have had Lord Triton down\r\n",
      "here to woo her with his philanthropy, he might have carried her off\r\n",
      "before the year was over. There was no safety in anything else. Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon had prepared all this as beautifully as possible. He made\r\n",
      "himself disagreeable—or it pleased God to make him so—and then he dared\r\n",
      "her to contradict him. It’s the way to make any trumpery tempting, to\r\n",
      "ticket it at a high price in that way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know what you mean by wrong, Cadwallader,” said Sir James,\r\n",
      "still feeling a little stung, and turning round in his chair towards\r\n",
      "the Rector. “He’s not a man we can take into the family. At least, I\r\n",
      "must speak for myself,” he continued, carefully keeping his eyes off\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke. “I suppose others will find his society too pleasant to\r\n",
      "care about the propriety of the thing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke, good-humoredly, nursing his\r\n",
      "leg, “I can’t turn my back on Dorothea. I must be a father to her up to\r\n",
      "a certain point. I said, ‘My dear, I won’t refuse to give you away.’ I\r\n",
      "had spoken strongly before. But I can cut off the entail, you know. It\r\n",
      "will cost money and be troublesome; but I can do it, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke nodded at Sir James, and felt that he was both showing his\r\n",
      "own force of resolution and propitiating what was just in the Baronet’s\r\n",
      "vexation. He had hit on a more ingenious mode of parrying than he was\r\n",
      "aware of. He had touched a motive of which Sir James was ashamed. The\r\n",
      "mass of his feeling about Dorothea’s marriage to Ladislaw was due\r\n",
      "partly to excusable prejudice, or even justifiable opinion, partly to a\r\n",
      "jealous repugnance hardly less in Ladislaw’s case than in Casaubon’s.\r\n",
      "He was convinced that the marriage was a fatal one for Dorothea. But\r\n",
      "amid that mass ran a vein of which he was too good and honorable a man\r\n",
      "to like the avowal even to himself: it was undeniable that the union of\r\n",
      "the two estates—Tipton and Freshitt—lying charmingly within a\r\n",
      "ring-fence, was a prospect that flattered him for his son and heir.\r\n",
      "Hence when Mr. Brooke noddingly appealed to that motive, Sir James felt\r\n",
      "a sudden embarrassment; there was a stoppage in his throat; he even\r\n",
      "blushed. He had found more words than usual in the first jet of his\r\n",
      "anger, but Mr. Brooke’s propitiation was more clogging to his tongue\r\n",
      "than Mr. Cadwallader’s caustic hint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Celia was glad to have room for speech after her uncle’s suggestion\r\n",
      "of the marriage ceremony, and she said, though with as little eagerness\r\n",
      "of manner as if the question had turned on an invitation to dinner, “Do\r\n",
      "you mean that Dodo is going to be married directly, uncle?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In three weeks, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, helplessly. “I can do\r\n",
      "nothing to hinder it, Cadwallader,” he added, turning for a little\r\n",
      "countenance toward the Rector, who said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_I_ should not make any fuss about it. If she likes to be poor, that\r\n",
      "is her affair. Nobody would have said anything if she had married the\r\n",
      "young fellow because he was rich. Plenty of beneficed clergy are poorer\r\n",
      "than they will be. Here is Elinor,” continued the provoking husband;\r\n",
      "“she vexed her friends by me: I had hardly a thousand a-year—I was a\r\n",
      "lout—nobody could see anything in me—my shoes were not the right\r\n",
      "cut—all the men wondered how a woman could like me. Upon my word, I\r\n",
      "must take Ladislaw’s part until I hear more harm of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Humphrey, that is all sophistry, and you know it,” said his wife.\r\n",
      "“Everything is all one—that is the beginning and end with you. As if\r\n",
      "you had not been a Cadwallader! Does any one suppose that I would have\r\n",
      "taken such a monster as you by any other name?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And a clergyman too,” observed Lady Chettam with approbation. “Elinor\r\n",
      "cannot be said to have descended below her rank. It is difficult to say\r\n",
      "what Mr. Ladislaw is, eh, James?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James gave a small grunt, which was less respectful than his usual\r\n",
      "mode of answering his mother. Celia looked up at him like a thoughtful\r\n",
      "kitten.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must be admitted that his blood is a frightful mixture!” said Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader. “The Casaubon cuttle-fish fluid to begin with, and then a\r\n",
      "rebellious Polish fiddler or dancing-master, was it?—and then an old\r\n",
      "clo—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense, Elinor,” said the Rector, rising. “It is time for us to go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“After all, he is a pretty sprig,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, rising too,\r\n",
      "and wishing to make amends. “He is like the fine old Crichley portraits\r\n",
      "before the idiots came in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll go with you,” said Mr. Brooke, starting up with alacrity. “You\r\n",
      "must all come and dine with me to-morrow, you know—eh, Celia, my dear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will, James—won’t you?” said Celia, taking her husband’s hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, of course, if you like,” said Sir James, pulling down his\r\n",
      "waistcoat, but unable yet to adjust his face good-humoredly. “That is\r\n",
      "to say, if it is not to meet anybody else.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, no,” said Mr. Brooke, understanding the condition. “Dorothea\r\n",
      "would not come, you know, unless you had been to see her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Sir James and Celia were alone, she said, “Do you mind about my\r\n",
      "having the carriage to go to Lowick, James?”\r\n",

      "then it is all so different from what you have always been. You would\r\n",
      "have Mr. Casaubon because he had such a great soul, and was so old and\r\n",
      "dismal and learned; and now, to think of marrying Mr. Ladislaw, who has\r\n",

      "could do. James always said you ought to be a queen; but this is not at\r\n",

      "“Well, I’ve got a bit of news. What do you think of Fred going to live\r\n",
      "at Stone Court, and managing the land there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can that ever be, father?” said Mary, wonderingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He would manage it for his aunt Bulstrode. The poor woman has been to\r\n",
      "me begging and praying. She wants to do the lad good, and it might be a\r\n",
      "fine thing for him. With saving, he might gradually buy the stock, and\r\n",
      "he has a turn for farming.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Fred would be so happy! It is too good to believe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, but mind you,” said Caleb, turning his head warningly, “I must\r\n",
      "take it on _my_ shoulders, and be responsible, and see after\r\n",
      "everything; and that will grieve your mother a bit, though she mayn’t\r\n",
      "say so. Fred had need be careful.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps it is too much, father,” said Mary, checked in her joy. “There\r\n",
      "would be no happiness in bringing you any fresh trouble.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nay, nay; work is my delight, child, when it doesn’t vex your mother.\r\n",
      "And then, if you and Fred get married,” here Caleb’s voice shook just\r\n",
      "perceptibly, “he’ll be steady and saving; and you’ve got your mother’s\r\n",
      "cleverness, and mine too, in a woman’s sort of way; and you’ll keep him\r\n",
      "in order. He’ll be coming by-and-by, so I wanted to tell you first,\r\n",
      "because I think you’d like to tell _him_ by yourselves. After that, I\r\n",
      "could talk it well over with him, and we could go into business and the\r\n",
      "nature of things.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, you dear good father!” cried Mary, putting her hands round her\r\n",
      "father’s neck, while he bent his head placidly, willing to be caressed.\r\n",
      "“I wonder if any other girl thinks her father the best man in the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense, child; you’ll think your husband better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Impossible,” said Mary, relapsing into her usual tone; “husbands are\r\n",
      "an inferior class of men, who require keeping in order.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they were entering the house with Letty, who had run to join them,\r\n",
      "Mary saw Fred at the orchard-gate, and went to meet him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What fine clothes you wear, you extravagant youth!” said Mary, as Fred\r\n",
      "stood still and raised his hat to her with playful formality. “You are\r\n",
      "not learning economy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now that is too bad, Mary,” said Fred. “Just look at the edges of\r\n",
      "these coat-cuffs! It is only by dint of good brushing that I look\r\n",
      "respectable. I am saving up three suits—one for a wedding-suit.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“Oh no, they will keep two years.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Two years! be reasonable, Fred,” said Mary, turning to walk. “Don’t\r\n",
      "encourage flattering expectations.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why not? One lives on them better than on unflattering ones. If we\r\n",
      "can’t be married in two years, the truth will be quite bad enough when\r\n",
      "it comes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "flattering expectations, and they did him harm.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mary, if you’ve got something discouraging to tell me, I shall bolt; I\r\n",
      "shall go into the house to Mr. Garth. I am out of spirits. My father is\r\n",
      "so cut up—home is not like itself. I can’t bear any more bad news.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Should you call it bad news to be told that you were to live at Stone\r\n",
      "Court, and manage the farm, and be remarkably prudent, and save money\r\n",
      "every year till all the stock and furniture were your own, and you were\r\n",
      "a distinguished agricultural character, as Mr. Borthrop Trumbull\r\n",
      "says—rather stout, I fear, and with the Greek and Latin sadly\r\n",
      "weather-worn?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t mean anything except nonsense, Mary?” said Fred, coloring\r\n",
      "slightly nevertheless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is what my father has just told me of as what may happen, and he\r\n",
      "never talks nonsense,” said Mary, looking up at Fred now, while he\r\n",
      "grasped her hand as they walked, till it rather hurt her; but she would\r\n",
      "not complain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Not so fast, sir; how do you know that I would not rather defer our\r\n",

      "jilting you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray don’t joke, Mary,” said Fred, with strong feeling. “Tell me\r\n",

      "it—because you love me best.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is all true, Fred, and I am happy because of it—because I love you\r\n",
      "best,” said Mary, in a tone of obedient recitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "almost in a whisper said—\r\n",

      "and, bouncing against them, said—\r\n",

      "Every limit is a beginning as well as an ending. Who can quit young\r\n",
      "lives after being long in company with them, and not desire to know\r\n",
      "what befell them in their after-years? For the fragment of a life,\r\n",
      "however typical, is not the sample of an even web: promises may not be\r\n",
      "kept, and an ardent outset may be followed by declension; latent powers\r\n",
      "may find their long-waited opportunity; a past error may urge a grand\r\n",
      "retrieval.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marriage, which has been the bourne of so many narratives, is still a\r\n",
      "great beginning, as it was to Adam and Eve, who kept their honeymoon in\r\n",
      "Eden, but had their first little one among the thorns and thistles of\r\n",
      "the wilderness. It is still the beginning of the home epic—the gradual\r\n",
      "conquest or irremediable loss of that complete union which makes the\r\n",
      "advancing years a climax, and age the harvest of sweet memories in\r\n",
      "common.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some set out, like Crusaders of old, with a glorious equipment of hope\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "All who have cared for Fred Vincy and Mary Garth will like to know that\r\n",
      "these two made no such failure, but achieved a solid mutual happiness.\r\n",
      "Fred surprised his neighbors in various ways. He became rather\r\n",
      "distinguished in his side of the county as a theoretic and practical\r\n",
      "farmer, and produced a work on the “Cultivation of Green Crops and the\r\n",
      "Economy of Cattle-Feeding” which won him high congratulations at\r\n",
      "agricultural meetings. In Middlemarch admiration was more reserved:\r\n",
      "most persons there were inclined to believe that the merit of Fred’s\r\n",
      "authorship was due to his wife, since they had never expected Fred\r\n",
      "Vincy to write on turnips and mangel-wurzel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when Mary wrote a little book for her boys, called “Stories of\r\n",
      "Great Men, taken from Plutarch,” and had it printed and published by\r\n",
      "Gripp & Co., Middlemarch, every one in the town was willing to give the\r\n",
      "credit of this work to Fred, observing that he had been to the\r\n",
      "University, “where the ancients were studied,” and might have been a\r\n",
      "clergyman if he had chosen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been deceived,\r\n",
      "and that there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book, since\r\n",
      "it was always done by somebody else.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moreover, Fred remained unswervingly steady. Some years after his\r\n",
      "marriage he told Mary that his happiness was half owing to Farebrother,\r\n",
      "who gave him a strong pull-up at the right moment. I cannot say that he\r\n",
      "was never again misled by his hopefulness: the yield of crops or the\r\n",
      "profits of a cattle sale usually fell below his estimate; and he was\r\n",
      "always prone to believe that he could make money by the purchase of a\r\n",
      "horse which turned out badly—though this, Mary observed, was of course\r\n",
      "the fault of the horse, not of Fred’s judgment. He kept his love of\r\n",
      "horsemanship, but he rarely allowed himself a day’s hunting; and when\r\n",
      "he did so, it was remarkable that he submitted to be laughed at for\r\n",
      "cowardliness at the fences, seeming to see Mary and the boys sitting on\r\n",
      "the five-barred gate, or showing their curly heads between hedge and\r\n",
      "ditch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were three boys: Mary was not discontented that she brought forth\r\n",
      "men-children only; and when Fred wished to have a girl like her, she\r\n",
      "said, laughingly, “that would be too great a trial to your mother.”\r\n",
      "Mrs. Vincy in her declining years, and in the diminished lustre of her\r\n",
      "housekeeping, was much comforted by her perception that two at least of\r\n",
      "Fred’s boys were real Vincys, and did not “feature the Garths.” But\r\n",
      "Mary secretly rejoiced that the youngest of the three was very much\r\n",
      "what her father must have been when he wore a round jacket, and showed\r\n",
      "a marvellous nicety of aim in playing at marbles, or in throwing stones\r\n",
      "to bring down the mellow pears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ben and Letty Garth, who were uncle and aunt before they were well in\r\n",
      "their teens, disputed much as to whether nephews or nieces were more\r\n",
      "desirable; Ben contending that it was clear girls were good for less\r\n",
      "than boys, else they would not be always in petticoats, which showed\r\n",
      "how little they were meant for; whereupon Letty, who argued much from\r\n",
      "books, got angry in replying that God made coats of skins for both Adam\r\n",
      "and Eve alike—also it occurred to her that in the East the men too wore\r\n",
      "petticoats. But this latter argument, obscuring the majesty of the\r\n",
      "former, was one too many, for Ben answered contemptuously, “The more\r\n",
      "spooneys they!” and immediately appealed to his mother whether boys\r\n",
      "were not better than girls. Mrs. Garth pronounced that both were alike\r\n",
      "naughty, but that boys were undoubtedly stronger, could run faster, and\r\n",
      "throw with more precision to a greater distance. With this oracular\r\n",
      "sentence Ben was well satisfied, not minding the naughtiness; but Letty\r\n",
      "took it ill, her feeling of superiority being stronger than her\r\n",
      "muscles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred never became rich—his hopefulness had not led him to expect that;\r\n",
      "but he gradually saved enough to become owner of the stock and\r\n",
      "furniture at Stone Court, and the work which Mr. Garth put into his\r\n",
      "hands carried him in plenty through those “bad times” which are always\r\n",
      "present with farmers. Mary, in her matronly days, became as solid in\r\n",
      "figure as her mother; but, unlike her, gave the boys little formal\r\n",
      "teaching, so that Mrs. Garth was alarmed lest they should never be well\r\n",
      "grounded in grammar and geography. Nevertheless, they were found quite\r\n",
      "forward enough when they went to school; perhaps, because they had\r\n",
      "liked nothing so well as being with their mother. When Fred was riding\r\n",
      "home on winter evenings he had a pleasant vision beforehand of the\r\n",
      "bright hearth in the wainscoted parlor, and was sorry for other men who\r\n",
      "could not have Mary for their wife; especially for Mr. Farebrother. “He\r\n",
      "was ten times worthier of you than I was,” Fred could now say to her,\r\n",
      "magnanimously. “To be sure he was,” Mary answered; “and for that reason\r\n",
      "he could do better without me. But you—I shudder to think what you\r\n",
      "would have been—a curate in debt for horse-hire and cambric\r\n",
      "pocket-handkerchiefs!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On inquiry it might possibly be found that Fred and Mary still inhabit\r\n",
      "Stone Court—that the creeping plants still cast the foam of their\r\n",
      "blossoms over the fine stone-wall into the field where the walnut-trees\r\n",
      "stand in stately row—and that on sunny days the two lovers who were\r\n",
      "first engaged with the umbrella-ring may be seen in white-haired\r\n",
      "placidity at the open window from which Mary Garth, in the days of old\r\n",
      "Peter Featherstone, had often been ordered to look out for Mr. Lydgate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s hair never became white. He died when he was only fifty,\r\n",
      "leaving his wife and children provided for by a heavy insurance on his\r\n",
      "life. He had gained an excellent practice, alternating, according to\r\n",
      "the season, between London and a Continental bathing-place; having\r\n",
      "written a treatise on Gout, a disease which has a good deal of wealth\r\n",
      "on its side. His skill was relied on by many paying patients, but he\r\n",
      "always regarded himself as a failure: he had not done what he once\r\n",
      "meant to do. His acquaintances thought him enviable to have so charming\r\n",
      "a wife, and nothing happened to shake their opinion. Rosamond never\r\n",
      "committed a second compromising indiscretion. She simply continued to\r\n",
      "be mild in her temper, inflexible in her judgment, disposed to admonish\r\n",
      "her husband, and able to frustrate him by stratagem. As the years went\r\n",
      "on he opposed her less and less, whence Rosamond concluded that he had\r\n",
      "learned the value of her opinion; on the other hand, she had a more\r\n",
      "thorough conviction of his talents now that he gained a good income,\r\n",
      "and instead of the threatened cage in Bride Street provided one all\r\n",
      "flowers and gilding, fit for the bird of paradise that she resembled.\r\n",
      "In brief, Lydgate was what is called a successful man. But he died\r\n",
      "prematurely of diphtheria, and Rosamond afterwards married an elderly\r\n",
      "and wealthy physician, who took kindly to her four children. She made a\r\n",
      "very pretty show with her daughters, driving out in her carriage, and\r\n",
      "often spoke of her happiness as “a reward”—she did not say for what,\r\n",
      "but probably she meant that it was a reward for her patience with\r\n",
      "Tertius, whose temper never became faultless, and to the last\r\n",
      "occasionally let slip a bitter speech which was more memorable than the\r\n",
      "signs he made of his repentance. He once called her his basil plant;\r\n",
      "and when she asked for an explanation, said that basil was a plant\r\n",
      "which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man’s brains. Rosamond\r\n",
      "had a placid but strong answer to such speeches. Why then had he chosen\r\n",
      "her? It was a pity he had not had Mrs. Ladislaw, whom he was always\r\n",
      "praising and placing above her. And thus the conversation ended with\r\n",
      "the advantage on Rosamond’s side. But it would be unjust not to tell,\r\n",
      "that she never uttered a word in depreciation of Dorothea, keeping in\r\n",
      "religious remembrance the generosity which had come to her aid in the\r\n",
      "sharpest crisis of her life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea herself had no dreams of being praised above other women,\r\n",
      "feeling that there was always something better which she might have\r\n",
      "done, if she had only been better and known better. Still, she never\r\n",
      "repented that she had given up position and fortune to marry Will\r\n",
      "Ladislaw, and he would have held it the greatest shame as well as\r\n",
      "sorrow to him if she had repented. They were bound to each other by a\r\n",
      "love stronger than any impulses which could have marred it. No life\r\n",
      "would have been possible to Dorothea which was not filled with emotion,\r\n",
      "and she had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity which she\r\n",
      "had not the doubtful pains of discovering and marking out for herself.\r\n",
      "Will became an ardent public man, working well in those times when\r\n",
      "reforms were begun with a young hopefulness of immediate good which has\r\n",
      "been much checked in our days, and getting at last returned to\r\n",
      "Parliament by a constituency who paid his expenses. Dorothea could have\r\n",
      "liked nothing better, since wrongs existed, than that her husband\r\n",
      "should be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that she should\r\n",
      "give him wifely help. Many who knew her, thought it a pity that so\r\n",
      "substantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life\r\n",
      "of another, and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother.\r\n",
      "But no one stated exactly what else that was in her power she ought\r\n",
      "rather to have done—not even Sir James Chettam, who went no further\r\n",
      "than the negative prescription that she ought not to have married Will\r\n",
      "Ladislaw.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this opinion of his did not cause a lasting alienation; and the way\r\n",
      "in which the family was made whole again was characteristic of all\r\n",
      "concerned. Mr. Brooke could not resist the pleasure of corresponding\r\n",
      "with Will and Dorothea; and one morning when his pen had been\r\n",
      "remarkably fluent on the prospects of Municipal Reform, it ran off into\r\n",
      "an invitation to the Grange, which, once written, could not be done\r\n",
      "away with at less cost than the sacrifice (hardly to be conceived) of\r\n",
      "the whole valuable letter. During the months of this correspondence Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke had continually, in his talk with Sir James Chettam, been\r\n",
      "presupposing or hinting that the intention of cutting off the entail\r\n",
      "was still maintained; and the day on which his pen gave the daring\r\n",
      "invitation, he went to Freshitt expressly to intimate that he had a\r\n",
      "stronger sense than ever of the reasons for taking that energetic step\r\n",
      "as a precaution against any mixture of low blood in the heir of the\r\n",
      "Brookes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But that morning something exciting had happened at the Hall. A letter\r\n",
      "had come to Celia which made her cry silently as she read it; and when\r\n",
      "Sir James, unused to see her in tears, asked anxiously what was the\r\n",
      "matter, she burst out in a wail such as he had never heard from her\r\n",
      "before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea has a little boy. And you will not let me go and see her. And\r\n",
      "I am sure she wants to see me. And she will not know what to do with\r\n",
      "the baby—she will do wrong things with it. And they thought she would\r\n",
      "die. It is very dreadful! Suppose it had been me and little Arthur, and\r\n",
      "Dodo had been hindered from coming to see me! I wish you would be less\r\n",
      "unkind, James!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens, Celia!” said Sir James, much wrought upon, “what do you\r\n",
      "wish? I will do anything you like. I will take you to town to-morrow if\r\n",
      "you wish it.” And Celia did wish it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was after this that Mr. Brooke came, and meeting the Baronet in the\r\n",
      "grounds, began to chat with him in ignorance of the news, which Sir\r\n",
      "James for some reason did not care to tell him immediately. But when\r\n",
      "the entail was touched on in the usual way, he said, “My dear sir, it\r\n",
      "is not for me to dictate to you, but for my part I would let that\r\n",
      "alone. I would let things remain as they are.”\r\n",

      "anything in particular.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
